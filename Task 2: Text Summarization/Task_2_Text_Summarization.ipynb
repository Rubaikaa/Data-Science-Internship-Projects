            "so theres that remember pence didnt act alone he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials in fact according to the american civil liberties union the indiana rfra religious freedom restoration act is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment who supports denounces indiana law gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gayfriendly but the trend on the state level tells a different story perhaps were witnessing the final gasp of longago biases or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated former rep barney frank of massachusetts the first member of congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office said he believes republicans want the supreme court to rule in favor of samesex marriage to provide political cover in the gop primary were winning he told a crowd in chicago recently while promoting his latest book i guess if you look at where the country was on lgbt issues 10 years ago we definitely are thats assuming you are part of the we who believe lgbt people should have the same rights as their heterosexualcisgender counterparts but as the situation in indiana has shown winning should not be mistaken for having won for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of socalled religious freedom bills snaking through redstate legislatures or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when its raised in a debate or at a campaign stop especially with republicans controlling both the house and the senate pence and to a lesser extent jeb bush may be toxic now but america has a short attention span more importantly they are not alone frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls if that holds true in 2016 winning is going to feel very strange cnna year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline mike pence a koch favorite mulls 2016 run for president the story ticked off items on pences conservative thingstodo list while also noting his close ties to the deeppocketed koch brothers as well as other rightwing lobbying groups last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event the group is backed by the conservative koch brothers and supported gov pences taxslashing budget now pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians  why would pence ignore the pleas of indianas chamber of commerce as well as the republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill because theres a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was pences way of shoring up his street cred it is also the reason why republican jeb bush pences fellow white house hopeful who is viewed as a little light in that category was first to rush in to defend pence and the law one lesson here just because more than 70 of the country now lives in states where samesex marriage is legal does not mean 70 of the country is happy about it backlash aside the fact is pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump the very public debate that now embroils him  and arkansas gov  asa hutchinson and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year  is more than enough to drag the entire republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped pence was i expecting this kind of backlash heavens no for there is no way a republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights which unfortunately will turn numerous americans into singleissue voters i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy instead it looks like its going to be dragged down to a replay of pat buchanans cultural war speech during which he told the 1992 republican national convention we stand with george hw bush against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women and later followed with there is a religious war going on in this country it is a cultural war as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the cold war itself for this war is for the soul of america progressives may enjoy watching pences temporary fall from grace but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen ted cruz of texas who has indicated a federal ban on samesex marriage is not off the gop table and even if you think neither pence nor bush nor cruz will win the nomination someone has to in light of that listen to conservative former arkansas gov mike huckabee a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives discomfort with samesex marriage its like asking someone whos jewish to start serving baconwrapped shrimp in their deli or louisiana gov bobby jindal\n",

champions league remains the superior competition in every way the champions league is so important added deila yesterday we want to win the league and get into the champions league group stage thats the main target there is even more money now in the champions league so to get a good team to compete in that tournament is everything it is more important than selling players our prime target is the champions league and we have to do what is best for the club towards that end deila  now a more confident and assured figure than the man who took the parkhead job last summer  will assume personal control of the preseason programme and argue for the retention of key players the days of celtic jetting to the east coast of australia and back to play friendlies appear to have gone we have to be more prepared than we were this season stated the parkhead boss after insisting that last summers lucrative series of games in the united states austria and germany had been partly to blame for his teams subsequent 41 qualifying defeat to legia warsaw in poland i know we are going to be more prepared they are knockout ties in the qualifiers so anything can happen we just need to do everything as good as possible so that the preparation is 100 per cent we have to do what is best for the team if we dont reach it the group stages then we will have done everything we can if we are not good enough then we have to look for a new coach then he was only half joking you suspect the most important games of a celtic season now take place in midjuly before they have kicked a ball in domestic competition the champions league qualifiers set the tone for the rest of the campaign amid those circumstances finding the time to rest international players is proving increasingly difficult scotland play the republic of ireland in a vital european qualifier in dublin on june 13 when more than a few celtic stars are likely to be involved while the likes of fullback emilio izaguirre will also be playing for their countries through the summer by this time last year celtic had won the scottish title at a canter  allowing former manager neil lennon to grant key players early rest prior to the euro challenge ahead deila says that wont happen this time even if his side can find a way to shake off challengers aberdeen in the coming weeks for ronny deila qualification for the champions league is not all about the money but there are now 16million reasons for the norwegian to take celtic there by leading the team to a fourth successive title and all of them involve pound signs this week uefa confirmed their cash cycle for the next three years of european competition the last time celtic reached the champions league group stage in 201314 when they faced ac milan ajax and barcelona they won one match and earned 126m the same performance  or better  next season would see that sum rise by 4m if they reach the last 16 the figures crash through the 20m barrier and thats even before ticket sales uefas increase in champions league money gives celtic manager ronny deila extra reasons to qualify  to the rest of scottish football the prospect of celtic making more money is damaging to any hopes of increased competition to deila its a different kind of bind it is even more pressure conceded the norwegian as his side seek to stretch their premiership lead to eight points against st mirren in paisley tonight no everybody is going to be here said the norwegian boss hopefully we are going to win the treble and that is the main target our dream and hope is to get to the scottish cup final and win it if we do that then we will be playing our last game of this season on may 30 after the cup final the players will get three weeks holiday if they are playing internationals in june then they will get one week more so players like broony scott brown and stefan johansen would come back on july 1 in three weeks you cant ruin too much it is just positive for their bodies to rest they know what is coming when they come back to training before then there are big barriers to cross beginning tonight just down the road in paisley against a demoralised and struggling st mirren side who find themselves propping up the premiership table deila admits he is eager to secure a fourth consecutive league title for celtic as soon as possible  we want to win the league as soon as possible declared deila the games coming up now are important games but we have a good momentum now we play good football we train well there is good harmony in the squad i am comfortable that we are going to keep performing well i expect a good performance at st mirren we have a lot of players who have been rested a lot they should be ready for the game\n",

savings and loan in beverly hills suggesting the gang were attempting to hit two vaults at once mr connelly told the times the black echo was a fictionalised account of a bank heist that occurred in la in september 1987 it was never solved in the hatton garden raid the met police have said the raiders broke into the building on the second floor disabling the lift before lowering themselves down the shaft and breaking into the basement the men then climbed back up to the ground floor to let other gang members in through a side entrance before all making their way to the vaults where they drilled their way inside the raiders then broke into 72 safety deposit boxes before making their getaway in a white ford transit van parked outside the diamondtipped drills were taken from a building site in fetter lane an eight minute walk from hatton garden and nobody was ever arrested police are probing the thefts of several drills in the months before the raid including two hilti drills that were taken near hatton garden dci paul johnson pictured has previously said hilti drills were used in the raid  city of london police also confirmed today that they have passed information to scotland yard about the theft of two hilti drills the same devices used in the hatton garden raid in december last year in another development the sun has revealed that 80000 worth of diamond tipped drills were stolen from another site in south london in november using a van similar to that at hatton garden andrew royce of elmcrest diamond drilling revealed that the equipment could easily be used to cut into a vault as his firm is often tasked with converting former banks into hotels and housing cctv from the scene reveals that a white transit van parked outside his business for two minutes in november last year before two hooded men are seen walking past police are believed to have identified one of the men behind the jewel heist in hatton garden as it was revealed the gang could have been inspired by similar robberies in los angeles in the 1980s officers from scotland yards flying squad released images of three  suspects on saturday but refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader likely because he has already been identified meanwhile criminologist richard hoskins said he has identified startling similarities between the hatton garden raid and novel black echo by michael connelly scroll down for video  police are believed to have identified one of the hatton garden raiders after releasing cctv images of the gang as they raided the bank vault over the easter bank holiday  officers released images of three of the men but refused to release an images of the supposed ringleader which is believed to be because he has already been identified  the novel was based on reallife bank robbers dubbed the hole in the ground gang who struck three vaults in la in 1986 and 1987 and were never caught in the 1986 robbery the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend triggering alarms on the friday that were not investigated before raiding safety deposit boxes stored inside the vaults it was not until the week following the raids that police were called and discovered the robbers had dug into the vault using heavy machinery in very similar circumstances to the hatton garden raid criminologist richard hoskins noticed striking similarities between the hatton garden raid and crime novel black echo which itself is based on two jewel heists in la in the 1980s mr hoskins who also wrote murder novel the boy in the river told mailonline there is obviously a lot we dont know about the hatton garden heist but on the surface they look very similar i think that when the raiders were planning their heist they must have read this book or researched the robberies in la while the robbery is obviously terrible for the victims i think everyone can agree that this was a very smart operation and black echo sets out a very smart way to rob a vault the timeline fits almost exactly right down to the alarm being set off on a friday and the break in being discovered on a tuesday the hole in the ground gang first struck in 1986 when they tunneled underneath a first interstate bank located along famous sunset boulevard near hollywood in la the gang believed to number around four or five made a hole in the wall of a storm drain underneath las streets before tunneling 100ft through the dirt emerging underneath the bank vault they then used concrete drills and saws to cut a 20ftby25ft hole in the floor of the vault before clambering through and ransacking the safety deposit boxes in total they got away with 270000 in cash along with the contents of 36 deposit boxes worth up to 25million one box contained a sketch of a

            "with 20 goals to his name this season watford captain troy deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the premier league in fact deeney has been lighting up the championship for the last three seasons scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game the next logical step for the birminghamborn striker is the top flight and with watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go he could well be skippering the hornets in the premier league next season watford striker troy deeney won the championships player of the month award for march  hornets skipper deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading watford to the premier league  deeney believes he can follow in the path of charlie austin and danny ings  by becoming a premier league hit  watford are currently just one point behind championship leaders bournemouth with five games left to play  and deeney who was this week named the sky bet championship player of the month for march makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level he said ive looked at charlie austin danny ings rickie lambert and grant holt before that these are all people that have been in the championship done well then held their own in the premier league there is a sign there that you can really go on from the championship if you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals i want to make sure that when i go up there im ready for it i think you have to be very ruthless in the premier league and weve shown that we can score goals are we confident we can do it definitely watford  currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference  joined the promotionchasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss slavisa jokanovic took charge in october but referring to that period deeney who has played under seven managers since joining watford from walsall in 2010 insists it wasnt that bad he added it definitely brought the players closer together its just one of those things really in any line of work if your manager changes your job doesnt change watford have won 15 of jokanovics 27 matches in charge and deeney has been impressed by the serbians tactical flexibility ahead of saturdays trip to millwall he said weve got a talented squad so we can go from 442 to 442 diamond to 352 or 433 his jokanovics adaptability would be the one thing that makes him stand out former watford boss beppe sannino handed deeney the captains armband during his brief spell in charge  but deeneys role in the revival of watfords season not just as goalscorer but as captain cannot be underestimated beppe sannino made him captain before the start of the season and deeney seems to have taken to the role like a duck to water i was very vocal but now its a case of justifying why they have made that decision deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release deeney has warned his watford teammates they have three weeks of hard work ahead of them  the two are definitely linked he admits but its more down to personal growth and realising what an opportunity i had instead of being an idiot and just letting my chance go by ive just grasped it with both hands and become a better footballer and a better person for it so it prison was probably a blessing in disguise captaining watford in the premier league next season deeney admits would be the crowning glory after three years hard work following his release that would be the fairytale ending said the 26yearold\n",

claudia asked them there are rumours i dont know how true they are that you guys are grumpy that you havent made a mint the bands pr then storms in saying im not having this ive had to come on here to get you to stop can you get up were going the bee gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with clive anderson short  bee gees  its one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 clive anderson managed to annoy not one not two but all three of the bee gees clive tries to joke with the band but after calling barry gibb a t he said were getting on like a storm arent we clive in fact i might just leave robin and maurice then followed at which point clive revealed that hed never had someone walk off before but robert isnt the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning naomi campbell robert pattinson and peter andre have all cut their chat time short  especially when like with mr downey jr the conversation has turned to their private lives justin bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with one direction and compared him to justin timberlake and rihanna became annoyed in australia and cut off a chat about her film battleship when questions began to focus on her love life here are the celebrities who couldnt stand the heat so they got out of the interview  the model naomi campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview  breaking a camera in her wake  after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given  naomi campbell  in april 2010 naomi campbell who is known for her fiery temper stormed out of an interview with abc news kicking their camera over on the way the reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed liberian despot charles taylor naomi said i didnt receive a blood diamond and im not going to speak about that the interviewer continued to push the 44yearold until she ended the chat curtly saying thank you very much and walking off in court naomi later admitted that she had been given a few dirty rocks by taylor when she testified against him robert pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst when promoting twilight new moon he was asked about his relationship with kristen stewart  robert pattinson  when robert pattinson was promoting the twilight film new moon in 2009 he had an awkward runin with ryan seacrest ryan starts the interview by asking rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his costar kristen stewart ryan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his pr swiftly interjects and reprimands the radio host rob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned seacrest reveals that its the first time hes ever been cut off as rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesnt do anything to ease the awkward tension justin bieber might be close friends with one direction sorry i really dont what are we doing before walking out of the interview channel 4 presenter krishnan gurumurthy looks bemused as robert downey junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life  in the footage of the shortlived chat krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as robert goes to head out of the room the american star is in london to promote his new film avengers age of ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal seemingly amused with the reaction gurumurthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production teammember tried to remove roberts clipon microphone at that point he turns and says its all getting a bit diane sawyer a us journalist known for her investigative interviewing the horror was clear to see on roberts face as he questioned krishnan about where he was trying to

code when codes were generated in the 1930s old broadcast radio codes were sometimes used in canada radio stations used y and this was reflected in the majority of their airport codes starting with the same letter as shown with ywg representing winnipeg the australian business traveller stated that during the first days of air travel airports were given a two letter weather station code as the amount of airports increased worldwide this twodigit number rose to three so each could be given a unique code cities with similar starting names like dublin and dubai caused the labelling to deviate from a regular system with dubai adopting dxb when dub was already assigned to dublin the codes are known as iata location identifiers and are set by the international air transport association iata the triple characters are displayed on luggage tags at airport checkin desks to ensure they reach the correct destination full lists of the code are published biannually in the iata airline coding directory cocreator lynn fisher said she was inspired following hearing a talk about the rationale behind iata airport codes ever since ive found it interesting and recently did a web search to see if there was a site that compiled all of those stories the arizonabased designer said nothing came up so we decided to make one many airports change names over the years so their airport codes might

hamad international airport ended up with the doh code  many recognise lax to be the code for los angeles airport but the extra x on the end has baffled travellers for a while and can be explained by the transition from two letters to three  the inclusion of an extra letter is the explanation behind the famous lax code which was just la during the 1930s the airport added the extra x around 1947 to reflect the change in the number of required letters several others similarly adopted the x which can be seen in airport codes such as pdx for portland and dxb for dubai codes were sometimes worked out using the city it was located followed by the name of the airport itself for example lhr was used for london heathrow and lgw for london gatwick one of the funnier airport codes is cochin

orchard field and msy for new orleans louis armstrong reflects aviator john moisant and the nearby moisant stock yards lynn admitted the codes that make words like fat for fresno in california are her

            "it is seen as extremely rude in most human societies but it appears apes also use whispers to pass on information they do not want others to hear gibbons  better known for their deafening songs that reverberate around the forests they inhabit  have been found to regularly use the secretive form of communication the apes which are found in the forest of south east asia produce a variety of soft call types known as hoos that are almost inaudible to the human ear scroll down for video  lars gibbons like this one in khao yai national park thailand use soft hoo calls that are similar to whispers  yet scientists have found the animals use these whispers to communicate specific information to each other about predators foraging and when meeting neighbours the researchers found that predator hoos in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey a dictionary that decodes the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists researchers at wisconsin university in madison have been using computer algorithms to analyse the whoops and songs produced by the apes gibbons singing usually consists of a crescendo of notes particularly in response to predators this usually starts with a series of soft hoo noises that are only audible at close range but this rapidly grows to become much louder in most studied cases these songs are produced in response to predators but they also duet together in social song this suggests the quiet calls were designed to alert other gibbons nearby without alerting the raptors similarly biologists studying lar gibbons found they used a different whisper call to when a tiger or leopard was in the area dr esther clarke who led the research at the university of durham said the findings could also help to provide valuable clues about human speech evolved and perhaps even why humans began using whispers she told mail online hoo calls have been overlooked in favour of the more conspicuous songs we just didnt know they were using contextspecific calls at close range it opens up the possibility that their vocal repertoire is much larger than we previously imagined she added these animals are extraordinarily vocal creatures and give us the rare opportunity to study the evolution of complex vocal communication in a nonhuman primate in the future gibbon vocalisations may reveal much about the processes that shape vocal communication and because they are an ape species they may be one of our best hopes at tracing the evolution of human communication gibbons have one of the loudest calls in the natural world creating whoops that can travel for miles through the dense forests where they live most research until now has concentrated on their loud songs which the animals use to communicate with each other over long distances however dr clarke and her team whose work is published in the journal bmc evolutionary biology decided to focus on the softer hoo call types while these calls have been known about since the 1940s they have not been studied in detail due to their low volume and because they are almost indistinguishable to the human ear lar gibbons used hoo calls to warn each other of predators but also during more intimate moments like this  the researchers used models like of this snake to test whether certain hoo calls were specific to predators  different hoo calls appeared to be related to the activity the gibbons were taking part in like foraging above using modern recording technology and computer analysis dr clarke and her colleagues have been able to detect subtle differences in frequency pitch length and volume of these calls they recorded 450 hoo sounds and found there were six different types of calls being produced by the gibbons the researchers have been able to identify which of these calls are associated with particular situations the researchers spent almost four months following lar gibbons around the forests of mo singto in khao yai national park north east thailand recording their calls and behaviour they found that the gibbons produced individual hoo calls in different situations including when they were foraging when they encountered neighbours during duet songs between paired mates and when they detected predators this model of a bird of prey produced short low frequency and extremely quiet calls from the gibbons  this model of a leopard also produced low frequency and quiet calls from the gibbons when they spotted it  the researchers used a series of models of predators to test whether the calls were associated with specific predators they found raptor hoos were less intense shorter lower pitch and had a small frequency span they were the least audible of the calls raptors hear best in the 14khz range while the gibbon hoos were consistently below the 1khz threshold tiger and leopard hoos were similar suggesting that callers perceived these two predators as belonging to the same big cat class while both gibbon sexes displayed similar hoo calls female calls were lower in frequency than male ones the researchers say this is surprising as among mammals males tend to have lower frequency voices than females females also typically did not produce hoo vocalisations when encountering neighbours and often remained passive this video shows a white handed gibbon singing the more distinctive and audible calls while in a zoo enclosure  males however often interacted with neighbouring individuals the gibbons also seemed to use whispering during more intimate moments  much like humans do too writing in the journal bmc evolutionary biology dr clarke and her colleagues said duet hoos tended to be higher in frequency than the other contexts significantly so when compared with feedingleopard tiger and raptor hoos and raptor and tiger hoos the researchers say the study is of direct relevance for the ongoing debate about the evolution of human speech researchers say the findings could shed light on the evolution of human speech and why we began whispering  the ability to produce calls that are contextspecific is necessary for communication to direct the attention of others this behaviour appears to be widespread and was likely present in the ancestor of modern primates and humans the acoustic variation seen in gibbon hoos in particular may be similar to human speech in which subtle acoustic parameters like pitch can be important carriers of meaning chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of signature and to tell others in their group where they are biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet the noises produced  which is normally accompanied with loud hooting   are known as pant calls and can be heard more than half a mile 1km away even in the dense jungle but now one group of scientists studying the animal in the sonso community in the budongo forest in uganda have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them the researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling they believe this may help keeps tabs on an individuals whereabouts\n",

questionable genetic experiments some scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea for fear it could be misused to allow parents to select the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren chinese scientists have admitted to changing the genes of human embryos like the one above for the first time in history the announcement confirms rumors that some researchers have been conducting ethically questionable experiments  the team tried to tweak the gene responsible for βthalassaemia a potentially deadly blood disorder using a germ line editing technique known as crisprcas9 crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code unlike other genesilencing tools the crispr system targets the genomes source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level the dna cut  known as a double strand break  closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally for instance after chronic sun exposure but unlike uv rays that can result in genetic alterations the crispr system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome when cellular machinery repairs the dna break it removes a small snip of dna in this way researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome the team studied the ability of the crisprcas9 system to edit the gene called hbb responsible for βthalassaemia  however others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers researchers at sun yatsen university in guangzho have today published their research in the journal protein  cell according to a report in nature in the paper researchers led by junjiu huang attempted to downplay concerns by using nonviable embryos which cant develop into babies the team tried to tweak the gene responsible for βthalassaemia a potentially deadly blood disorder using a germ line editing technique known as crisprcas9 but the researchers involved said that their results revealed serious obstacles in using the technique on human embryos crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code unlike other genesilencing tools the crispr system targets the genomes source

small snip of dna in this way researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome huangs group studied the ability of the crisprcas9 system to edit the gene called hbb the team injected 86 embryos and then waited two days for the crispr technique to work nature reports that of the 71 embryos that survived 54 were genetically tested the tests found that 28 were successfully spliced but only a few contained the replacement genetic material if you want to do it in normal embryos you need to be close to 100 per cent huang told nature thats why we stopped we still think its too immature germ line genetic editing alters the dna in sperm and egg cells  meaning the changes can be passed on  until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells  nonreproductive cells like those found in skin muscle nerves bone and liver for example  to help them study diseases modifying the dna of human embryos so that dna changes are preserved in the germ line  the sperm and eggs  means such alterations can be passed on to future generations improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near 100 per cent efficiency in trials using mice a leading scientist has warned dr tony perry a geneticist at the university of bath said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children the warning follows a breakthrough last april in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living adult mice using the crisprcas9 gene editing technique the crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies we used a pair of molecular scissors and a molecular sat nav that tells the scissors where to cut dr perry told james gallagher at the bbc its a case of you shoot you scoreon the human side one has to be very cautious unlike other genesilencing tools the crispr system targets the genomes source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the uk but is permitted in the us and china a number of other groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos xingxu huang from shanghai tech university in china has been seeking permission to perform the technique on discarded human embryos after having successfully using it to modify monkey embryos that developed into live animals professor george church a geneticist at harvard medical school is also said to be developing techniques that could be used to modify human embryos dr luhan yang a scientist with churchs group recently outlined proposals to edit the human germline in an interview with technology review she proposed using immature egg cells from the ovaries taken from women undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer the immature egg would be grown and coaxed into dividing before a geneediting technique known as crispr would be used to correct the genetic fault that was causing the ovarian cancer however the project is not thought to be underway yet and it is not known if it has been approved dr yang however has been reported to have been involved in a similar project in china british and us scientists have already expressed concerns over the ethics of the latest experiment with one doctor calling for the research to be banned dr david king from watchdog human genetics alert said this news emphasises the need for an immediate global ban on the creation of genetically modified designer babies it is critical that we avoid a eugenic future if china does not want to get the reputation of being the wild west of the new eugenics it must join the many countries  including the uk which would ban such research dr george daley a stem cell biologist at harvard medical school said the experiment poses a cautionary tale he said their study should be a stern warning to any practitioner who thinks the technology is ready for testing professor shirley hodgson an expert in cancer genetics at st georges university of london said this is a significant departure from currently accepted research practice can we be certain that the embryos were indeed nonviable the fact that there were a number of offtarget mutations is clearly a worry many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea for fear it could be misused to allow parents to select the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren  while genetic modification of human embryos is illegal in the uk the historic decision was taken in february to allow threeparent babies this legalised the donor replacement of mitochondrial dna  the socalled batteries which power the bodys cells although the procedure has its critics it would not alter the genetic characteristics of a child unlike the chinese experiment alastair kent from genetic alliance uk which supports families with genetic conditions said patients would be interested to hear about the chinese experiment  but undoubtedly would be aware that ethical challenges will need to be resolved a dna technique which allows scientists to tell the difference between identical twins has been discovered with dna profiling police can identify a suspect with a strand of hair or a drop of blood  but it falls apart with twins who share 100 per cent of their genes but researchers at the university of huddersfield claim they can now distinguish between the two as twins grow their different life experiences create a variation in the hydrogen bonds within their dna this could be caused by such things as smoking sunshine exposure to chemicals or diet dr graham williams who leads the forensic genetics research group at huddersfield has created a method of heating dna until the hydrogen bonds break  identifying minute differences between twins he said we have demonstrated substantial progress towards a test for differentiating between identical twins in forensic case work last month a leading group of biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on germ line research amid rumours that it had already been used to alter human embryos in china edward lanphier chairman of the alliance for regenerative medicine in washington dc and four colleagues wrote in the journal nature that such research could harm other areas of science by provoking a public outcry they wrote it is thought that studies involving the use of genomeediting tools to modify the dna of human embryos will be published shortly in our view genome editing in human embryos using current technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations this makes it dangerous and ethically unacceptable such research could be exploited for nontherapeutic modifications we are concerned that a public outcry about such an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development namely making genetic changes that cannot be inherited at this early stage scientists should agree not to modify the dna of human reproductive cells their fears tap into concerns that such technology could be used to create designer families where certain traits are selected for in reality such selection can be difficult as often there is no single gene that provides a single trait and many genes have multiple functions\n",

            "cnncountries around the world have launched massive aid operations to help victims of the nepal earthquake but distribution of aid faces challenges as nepal is still trying to come to terms with the scale of the disaster with over 4400 dead 8000 injured and 8 million people across nepal affected numerous aid groups and at least 16 nations have rushed to send supplies and workers to the stricken country but now the nepalese government and army who are leading the disaster response face another problem how to effectively coordinate and organize the massive influx of humanitarian aid here are three major obstacles that are hampering efforts of distribution nepal relies on only one international airport to receive and deliver aid relief organizations say the tarmac at tribhuvan international airport remains jampacked with a large number of cargo planes several aircraft carrying essential supplies have been turned away or diverted to india and elsewhere the airport is totally congested even the planes which have landed goods havent been offloaded jagan chapagain the asia pacific director of the ifrc international federations of red cross and red crescent societies told cnn flightradar24 a live air traffic monitor shows that incoming flights have had to circle in the air several times before being able to land the united nations disaster assessment and coordination undac team who is on the ground coordinating international relief efforts says they are doing all they can to address the problem there are lots of flights arriving from around the world for search and rescue and thats the challenge were trying to address by supporting the airport staff directly said marcus werne a undac team leader but chapagain says that airport management is still chaotic with staff and military not being able to clear runways and offload supplies effectively according to a un situation report main roads in kathmandu are open but remote areas are largely inaccessible due to the mountainous geography infrastructure damage collapsed bridges and damaged roads access to many of the affected areas is reported to be extremely limited read the report the nepalese government has not been able to provide relief to all affected areas due to difficulties in transporting goods a government official told cnn the helicopters are small they dont fly in windy and cloudy conditions given nepals geographical terrain we cannot use surface transport much but we are using it said sagar mani parajuli the joint secretary for nepals home ministry the situation has deteriorated to the point where relief workers are as good as stranded pirtha raj joshi a disaster management officer for nepal red cross had to walk 10 hours to reach a office in one of the severely affected districts said chapagain initial reports from the ifrc say that over 36000 houses have been totally destroyed with the number expected to rise as teams arriving in severely affected areas continue to assess damages just two days after the earthquake struck nepalese authorities leading the response are still trying to fully understand which areas have been affected how they are affected and what the priorities are typically what we see also in other emergencies is that it takes a few days for supply lines distribution lines to stabilize undacs werne told cnn right now were working with a lot of secondary data and working on some of the key vulnerable areas identified prior to the earthquake he added the operation to get aid to survivors in nepal is still very ad hoc and it will be a few days before the distribution becomes organized because the government is still constrained by the scale of the disaster says chapagain cnns manesh shrestha in kathmandu and bex wright and jethro mullen in hong kong contributed to this report\n",

            "a virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the states egglaying chickens poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus but the us department of agriculture said monday that the h5n2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest iowas osceola county  prompting a massive bird cull bird flu chickens stand in their cages at a farm near stuart iowa discovery of the bird flu on an iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nations top eggproducing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the us with its breakfast staple  the confirmation means up to 53 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country seven other midwestern states have also been hit by the virus dooming nearly 78 million turkeys and chickens since march the virulent strain in question is the h5n2 a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply so far only two egg operations have been hit  the one in iowa and one in wisconsin except for a couple of backyard flocks all the other cases in the midwest have been at commercial turkey farms minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit far more than any other state turkey farm in this photo provided by bethany hahn is a flock of turkeys at a minnesota poultry farm the countrys poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the us department of agriculture  precautions most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in  but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu  officials say thats because minnesota is the top turkeyproducing state and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl h5n2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and british columbia us department of agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years the usdas chief veterinary officer dr john clifford said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus theres very likely to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter an outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly the government doesnt compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution that gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of us production hormel foods corp which owns jennieo said monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers wholl stock up on stuffing mix cranberries sweet potatoes pies and other traditional favorites however several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized but despite these measures the system doesnt always work according to experts the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time  which can prove difficult and if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans or a flock turning quiet while vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time this strain is new to north america once an infection is confirmed at a farm all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading these flocks are usually killed by pumping a waterbased foam into the barn following guidelines from the us department of agriculture the foam suffocates the birds within minutes if birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds its thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella the compost is then used as fertilizer\n",

            "less than three times as far as earth from the sun  close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform the dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit last  month around the ceres in the asteroid belt the probe is currently on the dark side of ceres and wont emerge until april there is high interest in the mission because ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice but feature five which appears as two separate bright spots next to each other in visible images didnt show up in the infrared images spot number five shows no distinct thermal behaviour he said dawn is currently too far from its target to find out why this is the case the scientists added it may be due to having a different structure or being made from different material more detail will emerge after the spacecraft begins its first intensive science phase on april 23 from a distance of 8400 miles 13500km from the surface said martin hoffmann investigator on the dawn camera team the origins of ceres bright spots which have captivated the attention of scientists and the public alike remain unknown the bright spots continue to fascinate the science team but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source russell said recent images from the dawn spacecraft reveal feature 5 at various angles as the asteroid rotates the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of ceres suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater as previously believed what is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight said andreas nathues a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for solar system research in göttingen germany ceres rotates in this spedup movie comprised of images taken by nasas dawn mission during its approach to the dwarf planet the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of ceres suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface  the alien mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the dawn probe hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on march 6  he noted that at dawn on ceres the spots shine brightly but fade as dusk draws in according to nature this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by for instance heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume scientists have speculated that the interior of ceres is rocky with a layer of water and ice the leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge cryovolcanoes due to internal pressure in the asteroid ceres is 590 miles 950 km across and was discovered in 1801 in january researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb 6kg per second now finally we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious alien world dawn mission director and chief engineer marc rayman of nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california said soon it will reveal myriad secrets ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible the long exposure made ceres appear overexposed and exaggerated its size a cropped magnified view of ceres appears in the inset image at lower left  dawn will be captured into ceres orbit in march marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft artists impression pictured ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter and is very similar to jupiters moon europa and saturns moon enceladus  both considered potential sources for harbouring life the presence and abundance of water in bodies like ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on earth and the largescale migration of planets such as jupiter one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early earth and moon  delivering organic molecules and water to earth ceres is twice the size of saturns geyserspouting moon enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface it lies less than three times as far as earth from the sun  close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform since launching in 2007 dawn has already visited vesta a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles 168 million km away from ceres the distance between vesta and ceres is greater than the distance between the earth and the sun during its 14 months in orbit around vesta the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history vesta and ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt ceres is 590 miles 950 km across and was discovered in 1801 in january researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface two strange bright flashes on the surface of dwarf planet ceres may have different origins according to new infrared images released by nasa the images captured by the dawn probe from 28000 miles 45000km away show that a pair of mysterious spots on the dwarf planet have different thermal properties the images were revealed as part of the first colour map of ceres showing variations in surface materials and revealing the diverse processes that helped shape it scroll down for video  ceres may appear to be a drab grey world but new infrared images suggest there is more to the dwarf planet than first thought the latest images are the closest taken yet and suggest that the icy body was likely once fully active images taken using blue 440 nanometers green 550 nanometers and infrared 920 nanometers spectral filters were combined to create the map  this dwarf planet was not just an inert rock throughout its history it was active with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions said chris russell from the university of california los angeles the alien spots on the surface named feature 1 and feature 5 show up in visible light images as bright flashes in comparison to the rest of ceress surface in infrared region 1 is cooler than rest of surface but 5 is located in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings last month scientists said this pair of mysterious bright spots could be towering water volcanoes but they said they need to take a closer look to confirm this federico tosi who works on dawns visible and infrared spectrometer presented infrared images of the two spots measuring their thermal properties what we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image he said at a press conference today  captured by the dawn probe from 28000 miles 45000km away the images reveal that two mysterious bright flashes on the surface have different thermal properties the upper trio is region 1 at visible infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths at thermal infrared the spot is dark  meaning it is colder than its surroundings the lower trio represent region 5 in thermal infrared the spot disappears  dawn observed ceres completing one full rotation which lasted about nine hours the images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at ceres surface from shallow flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers  ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a dwarf planet scientists think ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere it lies\n",

isnt going to slack off on her calls for breaking up banks and other measures to rein in wall street as hillary clinton prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality former maryland gov martin omalley who is also running for the democratic nomination is trying to steal clintons thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth in other words there are many signs that democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality but in other recent news the likelihood that new yorks chuck schumer will replace harry reid as leader of the senate democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality while schumer has been a very effective democrat and skilled legislative leader he is also a wall street democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state he is not alone even at his most progressive moments president barack obama relied on wall street donations for both of his campaigns despite all the talk from conservatives about leftwing socialism in the white house the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to democrats without much concern even in the 2012 election democratic populism cant really work within the current campaign finance system  the enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on democrats despite their political base to court big donors during the 1980s california democrat tony coelho serving as the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee and then as majority whip made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to republicans who had been outflanking them in raising money the democrats were and have continued to losing their traditional base of campaign support organized labor  which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing many democrats concluded they needed business by their side democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices in 2008 obama disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the postwatergate public finance system for campaigns altogether preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign while small donors were enormously important to his victories so too were business and wall street executives at the height of the financial crash when public sentiment had clearly turned against wall street the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill doddfrank that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years wall street with an army of counsel succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices democrats can make but it also greatly damages the partys brand name as the washington post reported the scandal that might bring down new jersey democratic sen robert menendez is the first involving large scale super pac donations at the heart of the story is almost 600000 that physician salomon melgen gave to senate majority pac possibly in exchange for favors this is not simply some sort of accommodation of democrats to the corporate system they dont have much of a choice without these funds they wont be able to compete in this election cycle independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir in conservative circles the koch brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda individual donors such as las vegas gambling magnate sheldon adelson are causing ripples every time candidates speak pressuring them to adjust their agenda democrats have found their own magnates for political support such as tom steyer and george soros this is why campaign finance reform is so important without congress changing the fundamental dynamics there wont be much room for populism to thrive even if democrats select someone like a elizabeth warren as their candidate or hillary clinton decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy there wont be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts the democratic party needs wall street more than it needs to take a stand against wall street those are the facts on the ground if democrats really want to take on wall street and tackle economic inequality they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system if campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures wall street would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence reform could level the playing field more often than not campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support a more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system if things stay the same democrats can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support\n",

            "cnnus president barack obamas recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the middle east is far from reassuring to the region in his interview with tom friedman from the new york times on april 4 obama explained us foreign policy moves on iran and cuba which friedman described as the obama doctrine  he stated that we will engage but we preserve all our capabilities by capabilities the president must mean the tools whether diplomatic economic or military to protect and defend us interests the doctrine is significant because it provides greater clarity about the us policy under the rest of obamas presidency instead of the new beginning that the president outlined in his much discussed cairo speech in 2009 us policy in the middle east remains mired in a contradiction between principles and action on the ground for example the president asserted in the interview that the uss core interests in the region are not oil are not territorial  our core interests are that everybody is living in peace that it is orderly that our allies are not being attacked that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them that massive displacements arent taking place yet at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment us allies such as the arab gulf states jordan lebanon and the legitimate government in yemen found themselves under serious threat and attack the syrian regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens and the middle east was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history implementing the core us interests outlined by obama in the interview is clearly not working there exist grave doubts about whether the current us administration is indeed ready to deploy the abovementioned capabilities it seems that the us will only use them when its national security is at stake and those core interests are limited to dealing with terrorism and nuclear proliferation only and not the broader aspects mentioned by the president the use of drone technology across the region the military strikes being conducted against isis in iraq and syria and the framework agreement between iran and six world powers on the iranian nuclear programs are cases in point establishing a region living in peace is clearly not an instance where those capabilities will be deployed and is not part of the socalled obama doctrine in the same vein the majority of the arab world and the entire gulf region look at the recently announced iran nuclear deal with a sense of suspicion and trepidation having directly experienced the problematic interventionist iranian policies for decades the arab world is simply not ready to give tehran the benefit of doubt on any regional issue but neither is it ready to trust us assurances that outside a nuclear agreement the us will indeed put forward a concerted strategy to contain iranian influence throughout the region or to defend the gulf cooperation council gcc states against any iranian threat instead the fear is that as long as iran abides by any agreement that might come into force later this year the us will negate downplay or simply ignore those iranian actions that the arab world considers as direct threats here actions speak louder than words and unfortunately one sees only the latter coming from washington at a time when the region is faced with unprecedented turmoil and transition the president even shifted the blame and directed his criticism toward the arab world when he referred to our sunni arab allies the president gave an exaggerated picture by saying populations that in some cases are alienated youth that are underemployed an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic and in some cases just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances what obama failed to do is to highlight that this statement is in fact also applicable to iran in his interview he never questioned irans appalling record on human rights treatment of the political opposition and minorities rights among other disturbing issues moreover the reference to saudi arabia being one of the sunni arab allies ignores the fact that there are nonsunnis living in the arab gulf and adds to the existing destructive sectarian tensions as well as the sensitivity of the nonsunni arabs equally the assertion that the biggest threats that they the arab states face may not be coming from iran invading its going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries  is another example of the detachment from reality based on a gulf research center study when there are 48 militia groups supported by iran operating in iraq and tearing apart the very social fabric of that country it is simply naive to suggest there is no iranian threat the bottom line here is that us and arab national security interests are no longer on the same page ever since the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 those interests have increasingly diverged to the point that the arab world is tired of false promises the ongoing operation of ten mostly arab coalition countries to protect the legitimate government of yemen is simply the latest move that underlines the determination of arab countries to take matters in their own hands the gcc states may accept the invitation by the us president to come to camp david his maryland country retreat and have an honest discussion with him about the situation in the region but they question the value of being invited for purposes of being reassured when they are already being informed beforehand of what is wrong with them the truth of the matter is that the region is not working and that misguided us leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region unfortunately the obama doctrine does little to change this and may in fact make matters worse\n",

follows a provocative speech by argentinian president cristina fernandez de kirchner prompting the foreign office to summon her ambassador for a dressing down buenos aires responded by accusing three british oil firms of working without permission the argentine government said it was taking legal action against three british and two us companies for exploration activities for fossil fuels on the argentine continental shelf without obtaining the corresponding authorisation the legal complaint listed rockhopper exploration premier oil falkland oil and gas limited and us firms noble energy and edison international  accusing them of sending a semisubmersible rig to explore a basin 120 miles north of the islands subjected to the illegitimate british occupation argentinas president cristina fernandez de kirchner centre poses with veterans of the 1982 falklands war during the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of the conflict last week  it also warned the rigs owner greecebased firm ocean rig that it could face legal consequences over the drilling the diplomatic row over the fate of the falklands has worsened in recent weeks after the uk government pledged to invest 180million in the islands defences over the next ten years president fernandez de kirchner last week promised we will see the islands form part of our territory again its not just wishful thinking her remarks came on the 33rd anniversary of argentinas invasion of the falklands leading to a conflict that cost 250 british and 650 argentinian lives last night foreign secretary mr hammond said cristina kirchners threats against those who do business with the falkland islands are as hollow as they are illegal the islanders have a perfect right to develop their oil and gas industry  and they can rely on us to protect them from argentinian bullying as they do so alicia castro argentine ambassador to the uk was summoned by the foreign office on wednesday yesterday in a titfortat move argentine deputy foreign minister eduardo zuain summoned the uk ambassador to buenos aires john freeman to complain about recent spying revelations by edward snowden daniel filmus minister for the malvinas  as argentina calls the falklands  said his government would try to block further oil exploration we want the owners of the companies to be tried according to argentine laws and international statutes he said adding that this could involve an argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in argentine waters although falkland residents overwhelmingly voted to stay british in a recent referendum buenos aires claims the islands and surrounding waters belong to argentina defence secretary michael fallon pictured today last month announced plans to boost the uks military defences of the falkland islands  last week the argentine president and ambassador alicia castro publicly attacked the uk governments plan to boost defences on the south atlantic islands mrs kirchners government has also suggested that british oil firms could be prosecuted if they start drilling in the waters around the islands without formal permission from argentina the outspoken argentine presidents latest comments came on april 2 the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1982 falklands war she reportedly said international law and dialogue not militarisation are the path to a reunion and sovereignty we will see the islands form part of our territory again its not just wishful thinking but a foreign office spokesman attacked the provocative intervention he said the uk has no doubt about its sovereignty over the falkland islands and surrounding maritime areas nor about the falkland islanders right to decide their own future we object strongly to recent statements by the argentine president and the argentine ambassador to london and so summoned the ambassador to account for these it came after the british government last week dismissed the threat of prosecution against oil and gas firms working off the falkland islands three british firms  premier oil rockhopper exploration and falkland oil  gas  announced that they had found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands which are claimed by argentina last month defence secretary michael fallon said the government was preparing to beef up defences in the falklands he said two chinook helicopters and an upgraded surfacetoair missile system will be part of a new defence package for the islands mr fallon said weve been reviewing the defence of the falklands we do that every so often and im going to be announcing to parliament later today how we are going to beef up the defences there how we are going to modernise our defences and to reassure the islanders that we are absolutely committed to their right to remain british and to the defence of the islands we are absolutely committed to defending the falklands the threat to the falklands has not gone away he said modernising what we are doing in the falklands was a response to the threat of russia russia has changed we hoped russia would be a partner to us  a normal trading partner that respected the rules of the international system but its turned out that russia is directly competing against and is becoming much more aggressive in lots of different parts of the world and we have to respond to that\n",

record for sex offending were nearly four times more likely to be convicted of such crimes the biggest study of its kind suggests sex offending could run in the family along the male genetic line the brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes a study found johnny savile left is accused of abusing seven women while jimmy savile right raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse  sex offending could run in families along the male genetic line experts claim the saviles including alleged sex abusers johnny far left and jimmy savile far right are pictured in a family portrait from the 1930s  mohammed jumale known as deeq left and  his brother omar jumale right were part of a 13strong somali prostitution gang that raped girls as young as 13yearsold  the findings show that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in risk between close relatives of offenders and men from the general population were genetically driven but the researchers stressed that this did not mean a man with a brother or father convicted of rape would inevitably follow in their footsteps the news comes after the high profile case of jimmy savile who it was revealed raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse it is now believed that his elder brother johhny most likely abused seven women at a south london hospital according to an nhs report over the past few years a string of brothers have been convicted of child sex offences including mohammed jumale and his brother omar jumale who were part of a 13strong gang that raped girls as young as 13years old anjum dogar 31 and his brother akhtar 32 were jailed in 2013 for the abuse of six girls over the course of eight years in oxford lead scientist professor niklas langstrom from the karolinska institute in sweden said its important to remember that its nothing mystic of course you dont inherit in some kind of automatised robotic way so that you will grow up to be a sexual offender razwan razaq left and his brother umar right were jailed in 2010 for being part of a fivemember gang that groomed girls as young as 11 in rotherham  anjum dogar 31 and his brother akhtar 32 were jailed in 2013 for the abuse of six girls over the course of eight years in oxford another set of brothers zeeshan ahmed and bilal ahmed were also convicted  the scientists studied data on all men convicted of sexual offences in sweden between 1973 and 2009 rates of sexual offending there are similar to those in the uk of the 21566 offenders nearly half had convictions for adult rape or child molesting other crimes included possession of child pornography indecent exposure and sexual harassment in terms of absolute risk being closely related to an offender only led to a small increase in the chances of committing a sexual crime just 25 per cent of brothers of sex offenders were convicted of similar crimes compared with 05 per cent of men in the general population according to the study reported in the international journal of epidemiology evidence from halfbrothers sharing either a mother or father and being raised in different family environments supported the idea that genetics played an important role in sexual offending more than half of the difference in risk was linked to nonshared environmental factors including perinatal complications head injuries and childhood sexual victimisation that affect an individual but are not shared with other family members less than one per cent of convicted sex offenders are women so it was not meaningful to include them said prof langstrom behavioural factors found in sex crimes such as impulsive behaviour hypersexuality and sexual deviance may be geneticbased drivers for the offences said the researchers coauthor professor seena fazel from oxford university said we are definitely not saying that we have found a gene for sexual offending what we have found is highquality evidence from a large population study that genetic factors have a substantial influence christopher davis left was jailed for 14 months and his brother timothy right given a community sentence for child pornography offences  the findings may point the way towards providing better social help to atrisk families many of which were already known to social services said the authors at the moment genetic factors are typically ignored when it comes to making risk assessments of those at high risk of sexual offending said prof fazel many of the families we are talking about may already be known to social services for other reasons and if we can predict those at high risk of offending with greater accuracy then it may be possible to shape these interventions and target education and preventative therapies where they could do the most good he said interventions might include help with setting boundaries and improving conflict resolving and social skills he said a logical next step would be a largescale study that took dna samples and looked for genetic patterns that may contribute to problem sexual behaviours prof fazel added but pinning down the precise genetic variants involved in sexual offending would be next to impossible requiring samples from many thousands of individuals which rules out the use of genetic screening\n",

            "a wartime scientist has revisited the secret underground factory where she helped build aircraft engines 70 years since the end of the second world war mary cartwright was 20 when she was called up to work in the laboratory at drakelow shadow factory in kidderminster worcestershire in 1943 she spent two years testing metal for bristol aircraft engines in the sites underground laboratory working as the only woman in her department now  70 years after leaving her position the 91yearold greatgrandmother has revisited the now defunct factory mary cartwright revisited drakelow underground factory in kidderminster worcestershire where more than 700 people worked during the war right  to produce aircraft engines now 91 the great grandmother tested metal for aircraft engines  revisiting the site with her son david mrs cartwright said it was strange to see it so quiet she worked as the only woman in its laboratory between 1943 and 1945  built in 1943 the factory became known as drakelow tunnels for its vast network of underground paths spread over threeandahalf miles it was one of 26 shadow sites setup to mass produce engines and parts for military aircraft and tanks that were built underground or into hillside so that production could continue if bombed designed by rover at the behest of the air ministry drakelow employed 700 people when mrs cartwright began working there arriving every day at 830am she used scientific formulas to analyse the ratio of metals in shavings given to her by the men spanning more than three miles the site became known as the drakelow tunnels for its vast network of secret passageways  the entrance to one of the tunnels which are built into hillside beneath kingsford country park kidderminster  another of the tunnels entrances in kingsford country park while built at road level it is 300ft from the top of the hill  set up by rover under the instruction of the air ministry drakelow was one of 26 underground factories established to allow production lines to continue if the country came under fire  with more than 700 people working at the site at a time it was one of the largest underground factories during the war  mrs cartwright was sent to work there in 1943 after being called up at the age of 20 she had wanted to join the civil service beforehand  a stretch of offices in the underground factory their windows were high up so that staff would not be distracted by coworkers walking by  the kitchen where staff would have eaten during one of the long underground shifts mrs cartwright had no previous experience when she was called up but said she just got on with the job mrs cartwright said while the tunnels were built to protect production lines from bombing by the time she began working at drakelow the worst of the raids had already hit the country right a newspaper cutting from 1941 detailing the deaths of three men killed when one of the tunnels collapsed during excavating operations id had no experience at the time someone i think my sisterinlaw just gave me a book which told me how to do it i wanted to go into the forces but parents in those days told you what to do and mine said no youll go into industry earning 3 a week she was also tasked with taking photographs of the metal for developing in a dark room next door while the factorys design was so carried out to avoid raids the worst of the bombing across britain had already occurred by the time mrs cartwright took up work she said they started building the tunnels in 1941 quite late in the war around that time we were being badly bombed but never when i was there the site was restored in the 1980s by the ministry of defence which installed two kw generators  tunnel 4 one of the main passageways used during the second world war to shuttle workers to their stations  after the war ended mrs cartwright trained as a teacher and spent years teaching pe in worcester she met her late husband cecil cartwright after the war had ended and the pair married in 1953 revisiting the drakelow tunnels with one of her sons john the greatgrandmother said it was strange to see it so quiet in 1936 the air ministry approached the car manufacturer rover asking them to help with wartime production by 1939 all motoring production had ceased and the company had begun working solely on aircraft parts and engines but when its coventry factory was blitzed bosses cited the need for a more secure setting to allow production to continue shadow factories were then created built underground safe from the shelling of hitlers army workers were free to work on engines for military aircraft and tanks a canteen that was reused  during the cold war when drakelow factory became a government bunker  the drakelow site was one of the largest spanning more than three miles built into kingsford country park the factory is 300ft from the top of the hill but is in fact at road level it was used to produce aircraft engines specifically for four models of bristol aircraft the pegasus hercules centaur and mercury when demand wavered at the end of the war some staff were kept on to continue working on tanks production of the meteor tank engine continued until 1952 when parts became surplus to requirements all production stopped indefinitely thee years later when the site was handed over to the ministry of works in 1961 the government converted half of the tunnels to become a nuclearsafe bunker known as regional seat of government by the 1980s it had been modernised again with new blast doors fitted to meet updated requirements it was decommissioned and sold to a private company in the early 1990s and remains in their ownership all my memories are of a bustling hive of activity i did enjoy my time there it was certainly an experience i just got on with it the drakelow tunnels or shadow factory was one of 26 of the same kind across the uk built into the ground or landscape during the war it was used to produce engine parts for four bristol aircraft  hercules pegasus centaur and mercury for a short while afterward the war production continued but to create parts for army tanks the site is owned by a private swiss company though historians are eager to turn it into a permanent museum and i just got on with it mrs cartwright told mailonline the metal could come in and it would be one of the men who would drill it into shavings id dissolve it in acid and then put something on it that would allow me to analyse it\n",

            "but this one is perhaps as close to a sure bet as youll find  the secret to winning at two up australias iconic game of chance punting analyst mike steward has outlined an approach known in gambling parlance as the martingale betting strategythe staking plan is outlined in the table below but seems simple enough to follow for even a firsttime two up player the essence being that if you lose you have to double your bet until your coins fall right a word to the wise however there is as with any supposed surebet or an almost cant lose system a catch  and that is that youll need a healthy bank of cash with you scroll down for video  scenes like these will be repeated across australia on anzac day this saturday heaving crowds of punters betting on the toss of coins in games of two up  the martingale betting strategy of doubling up originated in france and is used with levels of success by punters on anzac day throughout australia  the traditional game of two up involves two coins but many venues now play with three for ease of betting among the crowd  two up is one of australias longest lasting traditions it dates back to australias goldfields and the first recorded games are believed to have taken place in the late 1790s it is now legal to be played on anzac day across returned servicemen league clubs rsl and pubs versions will vary between the original twocoined game with three outcomes and threecoined version with two outcomes the latter preferred by many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters one of the most easy to understand betting staking strategies that punters use is what i call the approach otherwise known as the martingale betting strategy writes mr steward author of betting strategy doubles up to win for the website punters club hero its a system of betting which originated in france a punter simply bets a stake to win an amount of money if they fail to win with the first bet they increase their stake to recover their losses plus win the initial targeted win amount on the second bet and so on he added bet                               amount  1                                      1  2

doubles up to win to simplify this betting strategy lets take a simple coin toss where the outcome is even money each time i bet 1 on heads for the first toss to win 1 if the bet loses i will bet 2 on the second toss if i win on the second toss i have recovered my earlier loss of 1 plus my target winning amount of 1 otherwise if i lose i will have to bet 4 on the third toss to recover the 3 lost and still win my targeted win amount if i continued to experience successive losses i double the stake of the previous wager until a win occurs the martingale staking approach is alluring to punters because of its seemingly guaranteed approach to make a buck he stated i mean how many losers can you back in a row after all the game was still illegal in some australian states and territories up until 10 years ago wagering expert damian deguara who writes for website the great tip off told daily mail australia that its that one time of the year when the law permits men and women across this great country of ours to follow in the footsteps of our brave aussie diggers and keep to the old gambling tradition two up is a pretty simple game all you need are coins a wooden stick the kip to flip them into the air and a crowd of screaming punters yelling heads or tails most punters have their corner you are either a heads punter a tails punter or someone who goes with either depending on your intuition the doubleup approach is alluring to punters because it seems to provide a guaranteed approach to making a buck if you win youre happy and if you lose you increase your stake until you win sounds easy enough right but what are the real odds of winning and losing if you chose to use the doubleup approach on anzac day think back to anzac day last year and recall how many successive loses that a head or a tail endured over the entire day was it four five what are the chances of experiencing six losses in a row its actually about two per cent but that means it is actually possible on the bright side there is a 98 per cent chance that you would have made your money before this point come in spinner is the cry from the ringkeeper at two up games  the coins fly into the air during a game of two up the uniquely australian tradition in which punters bet on which way coins land it is celebrated on anzac day on april 25 and is associated with soldiers because it was popular with troops during world war i  australian army soldiers pictured playing two up there is no form guide or books written on pushing the odds in your favour as twoup is one of the fairest bets in the world for every twoup coin toss there are two possible outcomes heads or tails and punters receive even money if the coins turnup the right way which is as true as the odds can get said wagering guru damian deguara  versions of two up will vary between the original twocoined game with three outcomes and threecoined version with two outcomes which many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters spinner at the ready with the wooden kip which is used to toss the coins the thing to remember is that each time you lose the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money warn some professional punters  the attractiveness of this approach is certainly strong however the downside although rare in the example given is very significant mr steward added if successive losses continue the amount that needs to be wagered increases significantly the other thing to remember is that each time you lose the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money the odds dont change because you have already incurred such significant losses i spoke with an ex online betting executive recently and asked if the martingale betting approach was common amongst punters and he indicated that it was noted frequently he mentioned a time when a punter endured 16 consecutive losses inarow with the last 69000 bet failing before it appeared as though his bankroll had run out thats the problem with this approach that most punters do not realise he said it only guarantess success if you have an infinite amount of cash mr deguara offered a similar warning before you run off to the atm to load yourself up in readiness for a doubleup day of twoup remember that the perception of guaranteed success that punters have about the doubleup approach is not entirely accurate the only way that it can guarantee a win is if you have an infinite amount of cash and an infinite number of coin tosses neither of which are available to punters tomorrow two up is one of australias longest lasting traditions and is legal to be played on anzac day across returned servicemen league clubs rsl and pubs and has been permitted for australian and new zealand troops deployed overseas during this time of year the headline sounds almost too good to be true doesnt it\n",

            "but i now believe platinum is much better its 10 per cent more dense than gold so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight platinum is also inert  gold will cause reactions such as irritation and inflammation in about 5 per cent of people the left side of her face was droopy  until now  i helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight for lauren i used three links weighing 04g each this is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light this way we can easily add or remove a link in 2013 we carried out a study at queen victoria hospital using platinum chain implants on 18 patients only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant the study will be published in the british journal of ophthalmology first we anaesthetised the skin around laurens eye then on a workbench i linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight i required id previously done a trial run sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight i made an incision across the outside of her eyelid where it makes a natural crease making sure not to cut through to the eyeball i placed the links inside this incision above the eyeball stitching the chain in place from the outside in before closing the incision these nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body by then the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue when the chain was in place and the eye was open it sat above the eyeball and i can blink normally the procedure has made me look more normal  people dont stare as much its really boosted my confidence the surgeon  raman malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at queen victoria hospital in east grinstead around 100000 people in britain have facial palsy it can be caused by a stroke if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve it can also be a result of traumatic injury damage after surgery or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve  this happens in bells palsy which affects more than 28000 people a year facial palsy affects not just appearance but lots of functions too the facial nerve  which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides then sends branches across the face  controls the tongues taste buds for instance and the salivary glands so patients may suffer from dry mouth most also have difficulty blinking because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut however it does not control the levator muscle which holds it open while many patients will recover with symptoms easing within eight weeks laurens facial nerve was too damaged to regain function when she first saw me her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways this can cause all sorts of problems from dryness to injury five years ago i would have recommended a gold implant  in the shape of a very thin bar  fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid the extra weight makes the eyelid heavier so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes this procedure is used widely across the nhs so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye even when the eye is shut the implant doesnt touch the cornea when lauren wanted to blink her brain switched off the levator muscle which keeps the eyelid wide open the corresponding muscle the orbicularis occuli muscle which should pull the eyelid down does not work in laurens case because it is controlled by the facial nerve the percentage of stroke patients who are affected by facial weakness  however the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall thanks to gravity although it wasnt a perfect solution  at first laurens eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid  at least she could blink again over time the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves risks include infection and bleeding but these are rare i hope the implant will last lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice any drawbacks gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy says saj ataullah a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at manchester royal eye hospital platinum is more expensive but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions and as the implants are less bulky its also superior cosmetically this chain segment innovation seems to work well any procedure can result in postoperative problems but these appear to be rare longerterm followup is needed before we can conclude that chainlink implants are truly superior to other platinum weights such as bars but they are promising so far the operation costs around 3000 privately the nhs does not automatically fund it\n",

with sadness as joel wilkinson has a muscle wasting disease meaning he will eventually be left in a wheelchair and his life will be cut short the threeyearold from hull was diagnosed with duchenne muscular dystrophy just six months ago after his parents emma 33 and chris 36 noticed he was struggling to develop and learn to walk they were left devastated when tests confirmed their son had the incurable condition and that is likely only to live to the age of 20 now they have decided to make his short life as full of joy as possible joel wilkinson five was diagnosed with duchenne muscular dystrophy six months ago meaning his muscles will slowly waste away his sister phoebe five adores him and cares for him as much as possible  joel will eventually need a wheelchair and has a life expectancy of just 20  phoebe  plays only muscle friendly games that wont tire her brother out  and refuses to play games at school unless joel can join in  phoebe makes sure her brother is thoroughly looked after  she helps him put on his shoes fasten up his coat left fetches his cereal in the morning and plays with him in the garden right thankfully joels big sister phoebe five adores her brother and makes sure he is thoroughly looked after  she helps him put on his shoes fasten up his coat and even helps fetch him his cereals in the morning mrs wilkinson said we were heart broken when we discovered that joel had such an awful terminal disease we told phoebe as soon as joel was diagnosed that he had a problem with his muscles and that theyre weaker than normal it was important she understood so they could play games that wouldnt tire him such as playing with toys and painting weve told them both that the doctors are trying to find a medicine to help she now only plays muscle friendly games that dont involve joel running around and getting extremely tired phoebe loves her little brother so much and she even takes care of him when they are both at school as they share break times together duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness it usually only affects boys around one in 3500 although girls can carry the defective gene although not apparent at birth symptoms appear in early childhood boys with duchennes will have difficulty with walking jumping and climbing stairs the disorder is diagnosed via a blood test and muscle tissue sample sufferers are likely to need increasing help and treatments from the age of nine walking becomes difficult and a wheelchair is usually needed by the age of 12 as patients go through their teenage years they are more likely to suffer from complications such as chest infections most most people with duchennes survive well into their 20s and sometimes longer the eventual cause of death is usually a severe chest infection at the stage when lung function is already poor she openly tells their friends that she wont join in with any games unless joel can keep up too its such a relief knowing that shes keeping an eye on him when im not around mr and mrs wilkinson found out their son joel had duchenne muscular dystrophy just before his third birthday last year the condition affects around one in 3500 and causes difficulties with movement meaning a wheelchair is normally needed by the age of 12 mrs wilkinson said she hopes there will be a scientific breakthrough before that point she said his only hope is that researchers have a breakthrough in time to save him and the hundreds of other boys who have this terrible disease joel will lose the use of his legs first leaving him wheelchairbound but when at six months he couldnt sit and by two he couldnt walk they knew something was seriously wrong mrs wilkinson said results from the blood test in july said he had muscle dystrophy but it wasnt until the end of september after more tests that we found out it was duchenne the disease which results in muscle degeneration has already left joel unable to get up the stairs or walk long distances mrs wilkinson added joel struggles to stand up and despite only being three he looks like a little old man when he tries to get up its an awful illness but we are going to ensure that joel has the best life and with phoebes help we know hell enjoy every second phoebe will often clear away both of their toys so that her little brother doesnt get too tired she will help him put on his shoes fasten his coat and even helps him with his cereals in the morning when i tell them both to tidy up their toys phoebe will instantly stick up for him and say what about his weak muscles emma wilkinson 33 and her husband chris 36 realised there was something wrong with their son when joel wasnt developing properly the family have now decided to make joels short life full of joy  as well as playing with her brother at home phoebe looks after joel at school spending break times with him  its adorable\n",

injuries to his strikers have made him take a cautious approach to the last few games wrapping up the title but the defensive side of his team has stayed remarkably settled all season the 00 draw at arsenal was the 20th time in 33 premier league games that the chelsea boss started with his favourite back seven of thibaut courtois in goal with branislav ivanovic gary cahill john terry and cesar azpilicueta protected by nemanja matic and cesc fabregas no other topflight manager has come close to that level of consistency in selection from left gary cahill john terry and branislav ivanovic are three of jose mourinhos settled back seven  2 mario balotellis first start in a premier league game since the 21 defeat by chelsea in november was as frustrating as all the ones that went before the italian produced only one offtarget shot at goal before getting hooked after 75 minutes and defender martin skrtel played twice as many accurate passes in the forward half as balotellis nine his total distance run while he was on the pitch 44 miles was over a mile less than albion striker saido berahino 55 who was substituted at the same time mario balotelli failed to impress during liverpools 00 premier league draw with west brom  3 mauricio pochettino who demands a highenergy pressing game from his teams must have been delighted that they collectively just outran southampton to earn their 22 draw at st marys spurs are currently second behind battling burnley in the ea sports performance figures for the average total distance run per game thats a huge contrast to last year under first andre villasboas and then tim sherwood when they finished bottom of the same table mauricio pochettino points out instructions to his tottenham players during the 22 draw with southampton  4 louis van gaal blamed a lack of sharpness for manchester uniteds defeat at everton saying they lost three duels in a row before james mccarthy s fifth minute goal it didnt get any better after that paddy mcnair won five of seven duels but otherwise daley blind 5 of 8 and ander herrera 5 of 9 were the only other united players to win more than half of their individual battles james mccarthy slots past david de gea after avoiding the challenges of daley blind and paddy mcnair  5 robert huth was nicknamed the berlin wall by stoke fans and hes brought the same they shall not pass mentality to leicesters defence since signing for nigel pearson on a loan deal at the end of january the 30yearold has now played nine games and ended on the losing side only three times huth was leicesters best defender as they scrapped out the 10 win at burnley which got them out of the relegation zone making 14 clearances along the way robert huth right has played a major role in leicesters recent run of positive results  6 nathan dyer took the chance to remind swansea boss garry monk of what he can do after suffering a frustrating few months on the sidelines the 27yearold winger an automatic pick in the first half of the season made his first start since early february in the 32 win at newcastle against a toon team without a recognised left back he was in his element  winning three freekicks as he ran at the defence and covering more distance at sprint speed than any other player nathan dyer left showed swansea boss garry monk what hed been missing upon his return from injury  7 getting james chester fit again will be a crucial factor for hull as steve bruce fights to keep his side out of the relegation zone through a tough set of remaining fixtures the 20 win at crystal palace was the 26yearold wales internationals first 90minute appearance since dislocating his shoulder at west ham in january he was a key factor in keeping inform glenn murray quiet and also composed on the ball giving it away only five times in 90 minutes and winning it back on all but one of those occasions james chester centre battles for the ball with crystal palace forward glenn murray on saturday  8 blackburn need to find more goals from the rest of their team if they are to cash in on the prolific form of front men rudy gestede and jordan rhodes rhodes got his 20th of the campaign in the 22 draw at huddersfield while gestede reached 19  and if he gets another against ipswich next weekend gary bowyers side will join watford as the only english clubs with two strikers who have got 20 or more league goals the combination of troy deeney 21 and odion ighalo 20 has taken the hornets into the premier league because the rest of the side have weighed in with enough to make it 90 in total blackburn 13 points outside the playoff places have scored a total of 63 jordan rhodes celebrates his 31stminute striker during blackburns 22 draw with huddersfield  9 coventry still need a point at crawley on the final day to be certain of staying in league one but either way its likely they will immediately be looking for their 10th manager in as many years temporary boss tony mowbray turned on his team after the 31 home defeat by crewe accusing some of finding it difficult to play the former celtic and middlesbrough boss has a contract only until the end of next sundays game and has already told friends he plans to be back at his home in the north east the next day coventry boss tony mowbray left turned on his team after the 31 home defeat by crewe on saturday  10 bury stepped in to rescue the career of tom soares when he was let go by stoke in 2012 after starting just five premier league games in four years following his 125million move from crystal palace the former england under 21 international midfielder couldnt find another club  and had to play for nothing at first to earn a contract three years later hes close to repaying them by earning promotion he scored one and

            "when ulster confirmed the audacious signing of all black wing charles piutau this week the scale of their transfer coup was illustrated by the complaints emanating from new zealand im extremely disappointed hes going said steve hansen coach of the world champions having learned that the 23yearold had rejected a new deal with the blues and nzru in favour of a season in belfast in 201617 his views were echoed more robustly by commentators and fans alike that might not be the end of the shortterm kiwi exodus despite jerome kainos decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the lions in 2017 charles piutau rejected a new deal with the blues and nzru in favour of a season in belfast  flyhalf colin slade is thought to be deciding between a move to toulon or pau in france  while the latter club have already landed conrad smith the prospect of piles of euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the top 14 league the destination du jour for southern stars seeking a stint abroad what makes the piutau deal so eyecatching is that it is a bold endorsement of ulsters ambition and also a boost to the wider celtic game below test level that boost is muchneeded because there are simmering problems  as exposed and bemoaned by leinsters head coach matt oconnor last weekend the australian was infuriated by the softlysoftly stance of ireland coach joe schmidt whose final say on release of test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the pro 12 clash with leaders glasgow alun wyn jones can put his body on the line for ospreys and wales  it hurts the league said the australian which is absolutely true the pro 12 has a credibility issue due to the continuing absence of so many irish stars from so many matches while player welfare is quite rightly prioritised there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions no wonder the welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the aviva premiership clubs during the european rebellion last year a leading figure such as alun wyn jones gives body and soul to the ospreys week after week but still found the energy to face down the more rested irish in cardiff during the six nations he and so many others in wales would enhance the premiership if the irish cannot fully commit to a league  making it a fitting stage for piutaus class  they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for european combat with their provinces scrap the lv cup and bring the regions into an expanded premiership job done wasps forward hughes was clumsy not reckless  wasps players were incensed by the threegame ban handed to their no 8 nathan hughes for the collision which left george north unconscious last friday night and their angst is understandable the big fijian was clumsy but no more by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the lions wing as he scored a try nathan hughes was clumsy rather than reckless and didnt deserve a threegame ban  the disciplinary panel called the offence reckless and the reaction of wasps captain james haskell was priceless rugby is reckless he said the whole game is reckless if youre going to worry about that maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch the england flanker had a point the sport is founded on physicality and danger a player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated damaging contact however accidental but the suspicion lingers that hughes is serving a ban because north was knocked out if the scorer had jumped up and walked off its fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed fill world cup seats or face fan fury  is anyone really surprised that trying to buy world cup tickets is such a drawnout ordeal for those without the benefit of a corporate invite or a media pass before anyone pipes up securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of rootcanal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket the webb ellis cup visits a school in toronto as part of the rugby world cup trophy tour  we are in the costcutting age of doitallonline so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on monday at least the oldfashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit as so wonderfully evident at wimbledon tennis down the years ultimately the world cup will be a sellout but organisers better be right when they say there wont be the empty seats which blighted the olympics as if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of wellheeled guests cant be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena or even turn up at all signing sinfield is an inspired move  its been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt which is harsh on all concerned kevin sinfield is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in leeds later this year from the rhinos to yorkshire carnegie yorkshire carnegies signing of rugby league legend kevin sinfield is a statement of intent  he wants to play flyhalf and while the prospect of him igniting the championship at the age of 34 is farfetched he is a proven leader and winner and his mentality is what the union side at headingley are keen to tap into no doubt hell bring a few more through the turnstiles too but coach bryan redpath will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him it is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation leeds are another secondtier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile last word  team gb under the auspices of england face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the olympic sevens tournament in rio in hong kong last weekend simon amors side  nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of great britain ahead of wales and scotland  lost further ground to australia and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings one below the final qualification slot this weekend in tokyo they must try to catch their rivals from down under but they have been drawn in a pool with fiji who won in hong kong and are second in the rankings behind south africa realistically one olympic place is up for grabs behind those nations and new zealand and englands advantage is that the series culminates at twickenham next month sadly team gbs preparations  complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby  have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting\n",

was also made from valyrian steel and had been lost in a bet by petyr baelish to tyrion lannister as mr consell explained in the video in order to make magic steel we first need to know about real steel steel is an alloy  a combination of metal with one or more other elements it is mostly iron but also includes carbon  up to about 2 per cent a small change in the quantity of material in an alloy can dramatically change the properties of the end material the characteristics of valyrian steel can give us a lot of clues as to its composition continued mr consell strength and sharpness is going to require a bit of a balancing act in order to hold an edge a blade has to be really hard which is no problem for a highcarbon steel the problem is the harder something is the easier it will shatter which is no good for a king slayer mr consell first looked into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern reallife version of valyrian steel it has 06 carbon with silicon and manganese this would provide a balance of properties including a sharp edge but a spring steel sword couldnt handle high temperatures  he then moved onto the option of using air hardened steel it is cooled off in the open air when its forged and doesnt lose its properties when heated up air hardened steel uses a cocktail of elements but as mr consell added valyrians colour pattern and weight make this option unlikely  he first looks into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern reallife version of valyrian steel it has 06 per cent carbon with silicon and manganese this would provide a balance of properties including a sharp edge it would bend without breaking and be really hard to shatter but a spring steel sword couldnt handle the high temperatures alluded to in the books he then moved onto the option of using air hardened steel it is cooled off in the open air when its forged and doesnt lose its properties when heated up as an alternative mr consell suggests valyrian steel isnt steel at all instead the best possible match might be a metal matrix composite this is a modern super material with a metallic framework embedded with ceramics and one of these could provide all of the extreme characteristics needed for valyrian steel he said itanium silicon carbide might be the perfect fit because it has the strength weight and colour needed for valyrian steel and if the matrix wasnt  consistent it might have swirls of grey running through the blade  author george rr martin was said to have been inspired by damascus steel pictured steel used during the crusades in europe  air hardened steel uses a cocktail of elements and as mr consell added you better believe it would require magic in the medieval world to get these materials working together but valyrians colour pattern and weight make this option unlikely for example steel can always be polished to a grey but valyrian is supposed to be nearly black on top of that the weight of steel cant be changed as its mostly heavy iron additionally mr consell said the patterns of vlayrian steel suggest it has been pattern welded and folded this isnt a sign of superb quality and strength its actually a way of compensating for poor materials and trying to make a good steel out of two bad ones he said if the folding is done correctly you dont have visible ripples so thats kind of out as an alternative mr consell suggests valyrian steel isnt steel at all instead the best possible match might be a metal matrix composite this is a modern super material that has a metallic framework embedded with ceramics and one of these could provide all of the extreme characteristics needed for valyrian steel he continued a titanium silicon carbide might be the perfect fit it has the strength weight and colour needed for valyrian steel and if the matrix wasnt perfectly consistent it might have swirls of grey running through the blade there is also the opinion that valyrian is similar to damascus steel mr martin was said to have been inspired by the patterns and properties of the legendary damascus steel used during the crusades in europe across the 11th century for the books it is made from iron ore steel called wootz and like with the fictional valyrian the forging techniques used to make the distinctive blades were believed to have been lost in the mid18th century\n",

            "the man in the mask is back but it might take more than a slice of carbon fibre to protect cesc fabregas from what could be a quite hateful reception when he takes his first steps at the emirates stadium since he left to join barcelona that 2011 move was seen and widely accepted  externally  as the prodigal son going home this next fixture is seen by some as the return of a player who rejected a second coming at arsenal in favour of chelsea he will surely win the league having already won the capital one cup but what has he lost at the club that made him what of the line of communication he once had with arsene wenger cesc fabregas will be making his first return to the emirates since leaving arsenal in 2011  the 27yearold is expected to wear a protective mask when he travels to north london this weekend  fabregas joined arsenal as a teenager left before returning to the premier league with chelsea right arsenal boss arsene wenger speaks to a young fabregas after snatching him away from barcelona in 2004  it has been suggested they have not spoken since fabregas made the summer move that got so many backs up there is nothing terribly unusual in that except they used to be so close to the extent that wenger continued to text fabregas on birthdays and career milestones while he was at barcelona he hasnt spoken to me since i came back fabregas was quoted as saying in september it was the kind of relationship i always would have liked to keep but im sure once everything dies down a bit in the future we will talk there is no problem ill always be grateful to him whatever happens except there is still believed to be only silence from the man he once called his second father and for the first time the fabregas narrative is something less than delightfully romantic until now he had followed a largely clean script he was the boy who attended his first barca match as a ninemonthold baby with his grandfather the tale of how he came to be their player 10 years later is wonderful the story goes that he was playing for mataro 35km north of barcelona rodolfo borrell used to search the surrounding areas for young players for barcas under 11s side and one day watched fabregass team nothing to report when he came back two months later in september 1997 he saw a midfielder he simply needed to sign gunners legend dennis bergkamp watches on as fabregas plays a pass during training early in his career  fabregas only piece of major silverware with arsenal was winning the 2005 fa cup against man united  former captain thierry henry right helped fabregas come through the ranks at arsenal  fabregas impressed by scoring against juventus as arsenal reached the 2006 champions league final  the spaniard is involved in a scuffle with his future club during the 2007 carling cup final  i went to see them play again and suddenly i saw this one player who was simply wonderful he told the bbc they told me he was called cesc fabregas and he was one year younger than the rest he was good at running with the ball had a fantastic pass over short medium and long distances he was very mature for his age and had all the attributes we were looking for at barcelona at that time at halftime i asked the coach why i had not seen this kid before he admitted that when he saw me coming he had decided not to play him because he knew that if i saw him i would take him he ultimately became part of a group that included lionel messi coming through the ranks his idol was pep guardiola and when fabregass parents divorced in 2001 guardiola handed him a signed shirt with the message one day you will be the number four of barcelona wenger bestows his wisdom on a young fabregas during a training session at london colney in 2008  fabregas celebrates a a goal with former arsenal teammates emmanuel adebayor left and tomas rosicky  fabregas holds aloft the trophy after winning the the 2008 european championships with spain  fabregas lifts the emirates cup after winning the preseason tournament with arsenal in 2009  fabregas trains with another arsenal star to leave the emirates robin van persie in 2010  the arsenal playmaker scores a penalty against braga in the champions league in 2010  alas barcelona  lionel messi right celebrates with fabregas after scoring his first goal for barcelona in 2011  fabregas scored against italy in the group stages as spain went on to win the 2012 european championship  fabregas gets involved in a row with chelsea stars as barcelona are sent out of the 2012 champions league  spain stars andres iniesta left fernando torres centre and fabregas crash out of the 2014 world cup  by that point it would be hard to blame the rationale in wanting a move to barcelona but staff at arsenal were disappointed in how the switch was pushed through what followed was a threeseason spell that has perhaps been unfairly characterised the suggestion is that he underperformed at barca which in part is the fault of the club itself upon leaving last summer the club oddly flagged up in an official statement that he tends to flag in the second half of seasons they were right as this campaign has proved but it was unusual for a club to say so much in any case he won la liga copa del rey and club world cup winners medals and in his second season only victor valdes had more la liga starts it was not exceptional though and last summer came the chance to leave bringing with it much of the confusion that still surrounds the midfielder wenger himself gave the impression that there is more to know about the circumstances behind the move to chelsea saying on thursday we will have to discuss that one day with all the terms the 27yearold celebrates scoring against stoke in his debut season at stamford bridge  fabregas played against his former club with chelsea for the first time in october 2014  fabregas still keeps in touch with arsenal legend henry with the pair attending a nba game in london  fabregas celebrates scoring the only goal against local rivals qpr at loftus road earlier this month  fabregas wears a protective mask as chelsea defeat manchester united to close in on the 2015 title  sport analysts bsports are predicting a tight match with arsenal slight favourites to beat chelsea  fabregas said in a statement last summer that arsenal decided not to trigger an option they held to resign him wenger has previously claimed that by the time he knew fabregas was available a deal with chelsea was almost done it is interesting to wonder how much from either side is pr and how much is genuine did either side really want the other at the very least fabregas will likely endure a tough afternoon under his mask on sunday he might soon have that league title he craved but it will not have come without some significant losses he left for arsenal in 2003 having not been picked for a single firstteam game by the time he returned in 2011 he had become arsenals youngest firstteam player their captain and a european championship and world cup winner with spain in 2005 aged 18 and with 60 firstteam games already played he told the independent i will always be a fan of barcelona but arsenal gave me an opportunity its like you are standing at a station and theres a train that you must take its the opportunity of your life at barcelona i was playing for the under 16s here they gave me the opportunity to play for the reserves straight away soon the carling cup it gave me the motivation that i needed now i want to improve get more mature get more experience fabregas celebrates with spain teammate david villa en route to wining the 2010 world cup in south africa  spain teammates attempt to engineer a move to barcelona by pulling a club shirt over fabregas in 2010  fabregas walks off dejected after arsenal crash out to his boyhood club barca in the 2011 champions league  the midfielders relationship with mentor wenger became strained after he left arsenal in 2011  six years on from that interview he detailed his relationship with the club and wenger as he explained why he was joining guardiolas barcelona\n",

not apply to the agriculture industry except for the requirement that it report more information on its groundwater use the exclusion prompted some criticism as agriculture uses about 80 of californias developed water supply farms in the state have taken a hit with reduced water allocations and thousands of farmworkers laid off but climate writer eric holthaus of slate wrote that wasteful agriculture is literally sucking california dry the action comes as the sierra nevada snowpack which californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs is near a record low one famed golf course group said it should be able to keep its fairways and greens green david stivers an executive vice president of the pebble beach company said his company is studying the restrictions to see what effect it will have on business it will not affect our golf course irrigation because we use recycled waste water for golf course irrigation from a plant we built in 1994 he said the company operates pebble beach golf links spyglass hill golf course and the links at spanish bay as well as three hotels he said the drought has yet to hurt revenue people up here are also very conscious about water usage and the expense of water in this area he said pepperdine university in malibu known for its beautiful campus said it would be challenging to meet the restrictions given the watersaving practices already in effect  the school already uses recycled and reclaimed water for campus irrigation and now it has turned off all fountains on campus according to rhiannon bailard director of the universitys center for sustainability the university was also encouraging students to further reduce water usage in addition browns executive order will   impose significant cuts in water use on campuses golf courses cemeteries and other large landscapes  replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with droughttolerant landscaping  create a temporary statewide consumer rebate program to replace old appliances with water efficient models  prohibit new homes and developments from irrigating with potable water unless waterefficient drip irrigation systems are used  ban watering of ornamental grass on public street medians  require agricultural water users to report more water use information to state regulators increasing the states ability to enforce against illegal diversions and waste its a different world brown said wednesday we have to act differently a staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for california to recover from the emergency the estimate is based on nasa satellite data analysis of how much water the states reserves lack thats more than 14000 times the amount of water it would take to fill the dallas cowboys stadium according to cnn calculations its the amount of water that flows over niagara falls in about 170 days time the entire state faces at least a moderate drought and more than half of the state faces the worst category of dryness called an exceptional drought according to the us drought monitor california isnt the only state feeling an absence of rain as of late september 30 of the lower 48 faced at least a moderate drought particularly in the southwest states neighboring california and in texas the drought monitor says but none of those states is facing the extremes of california where the drought has been a slowly building natural disaster since 2012 in fact brown last year declared a state emergency saying his constituents are facing perhaps the worst drought that california has ever seen since records began about 100 years ago opinion the end of the la lawn  on september 16 brown signed historic legislation that created a framework for sustainable local groundwater management for the first time in california history the governors office said before the new legislation california was the only western state that didnt manage its groundwater officials said last month brown unveiled an emergency 1 billion spending plan to tackle the states historic drought according to the state water resources control board the package will specifically accelerate 128 million from the governors budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities proposition 1 funding which enacted the water quality supply and infrastructure improvement act of 2014 will funnel 272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure some 660 million from prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas as part of the changes brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as california enters the fourth year of a worsening water crisis the march snowpack measurement came in at 09 inches of water content in the snow just 5 of the march 3 historical average for the measurement site the overall water content for the northern sierra snowpack came in at 44 inches just 16 of average for the date central and southern sierra readings were 55 inches 20 of average and 5 inches 22 of average respectively only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower cnns tony

seconds at speeds above 373mph 600kmh during a run near mount fuji it beat last weeks speeds of 366mph 590kph which in turn beat the trains previous record of 361mph 581kmh the  train is able to go this fast because it makes use of a charge to lift and move it above a guideway it hovers four inches 10cm above the tracks and is propelled by electrically charged magnets the technology promises a ride thats smoother quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional highspeed rail owner central japan railway plans to have a train in service in 2027 to join tokyo and the central city of nagoya  a distance of 177 miles 286km the speeds however wont be as high when the new line between tokyo and nagoya comes into service maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track this eliminates the need for wheels and therefore reduces friction providing a faster and quieter service acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains and maglev also makes for much smoother journeys right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres 250 miles per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds but vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future according to engineers the trains will travel at 314mph 505kmh  but this will still cut the journey time for the journey by more than half for comparison the uks hs2 rail line will run at 224mph 360kmh by 2045 maglev trains are expected to link tokyo and osaka in just 67 minutes slashing the journey time in half the maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1000 passengers at a time japan is wellestablished as the world leader in highspeed trains having developed the first bullet train in 1964 it is now hoping to bring the technology to the us and has outlined plans for a line between washington and baltimore which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century the first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively lowspeed shuttle at birmingham international airport in 1984 this travelled at a rather mundane 26mph 42kmhr it was not until the turn of the century though that highspeed maglev would come into commercial operation mostly in japan and china maglev trains pictured hover four inches 10cm above the tracks and is propelled by electrically charged magnets this eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction providing a faster and quieter service acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains  china was the first country to have a commerciallyoperated maglev service the shanghai maglev opened to the public in january 2004 and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track lengthit cost 13billion 830million to build manufacturers claim that maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities but not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe andy kunz president of the us high speed rail association told the los angeles times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive powerintensive and potentially unsafe the problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the earth  which happens all the time because of plate tectonics  that can create little movements in the maglev system which can send trains crashing into stuff he said by 2045 maglev trains example pictured are expected to link tokyo and osaka in just

limits even higher last year chinas first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the applied superconductivity laboratory of southwest jiaotong university the technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains ett evacuated tube transport systems might allow hts maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude such as superhigh 3000km 1800 miles per hour which could be applied to some military or space launch systems the researchers write pictured on the left is a

            "teachers can judge the behaviour of black students more harshly than while pupils new research has suggested a study by researchers at stanford university examined the reaction of secondary and primary school teachers in the united states to student race they found that the teachers were more likely to view youngsters who they thought were black as troublemakers than those they thought were white teachers tend to see black pupils as more likely to cause trouble in the future if they have misbehaved in the past according to new research that attempted to examine the impact of racial stereotypes in us schools  the researchers say this may go someway towards explaining why black children are often disciplined more at schools compared to other pupils professor jennifer eberhardt a psychologist at stanford university said the fact that black children are disproportionately disciplined in school is behind dispute what is less clear is why we see that stereotypes not only can be used to allow people to interpret a specific behavior in isolation but also stereotypes can heighten our sensitivity to behavioral patterns across time some of the worlds most troubling times which have included periods of intense racism have occurred during economic downturns and now a new study has found that people really do have a tendency to become more racist during a recession researchers found that faces seem blacker and have stronger racial features during an economic downturn and this in turn increases the likelihood of discrimination the study by new york university claims that conditions of resource scarcity alter peoples perception of race their work follows a study last year which suggested racism is on the rise in the uk fuelled by financial strife in four experiments involving 285 nonblack americans scientists david amodio and amy krosch found people see faces different during an economic downturn this pattern sensitivity is especially relevant in the schooling context in their study which is published in the journal psychological science professor eberhardt and her colleagues presented teachers with fictional school records these records described two instances of misbehaviour by a student the teachers were asked about their perception of the severity how irritated that misbehaviour would make them and how the student should be punished they were also asked whether they saw the student as a troublemaker and if they could imagine themselves suspending that pupil in the future the researchers randomly assigned names to the student records in some cases suggesting the student was black with names like deshawn or darnell and in others suggesting they were white with names like greg or jake the researchers found that racial stereotypes had little impact on the teachers views of the pupils after one infraction however the second piece of misbehaviour was seen as more troubling when committed by a black student rather than a white one the researchers examined the views of both primary and secondary school teachers to see if their opinions of fictional pupils were altered by racial stereotypes and found they tended to judge black students more harshly  in the us black students are disproportionately punished for misbehaviour compared to white students  the teachers also tended to want to discipline black students more harshly as they were more likely to see the misbehaviour as part of a pattern the race of the teachers who took part in the study was not immediately clear but mail online has contacted the researchers for more information jason okonofua who also took part in the study said the findings had implications beyond the school system he said most social relationships entail repeated encounters interactions between police officers and civilians between employers and employees between prison guards and prisoners all may be subject to the sort of stereotype escalation effect we have identified in our research the researchers suggest that psychological interventions could be used to help change the stereotypes of black students influencing the way teachers treat pupils in 2005 trevor phillips then the chairman of the commission for racial equality in the uk suggested that black boys should be taught in separate classes in order to improve their educational achievements as a group his controversial idea was met with opposition from some who said ghetto culture was to blame for the poor classroom performance of black boys not just racism\n",

officials the local council and surf life saving sa to post signs on the beach warning others promptly after the shark attack the attack happened during conditions that police and marine experts have previously said are dangerous the overcast conditions make it difficult for surfers to see sharks that might be in the area and it is believed that sharks often mistake humans for seals or dolphins the incident comes after surfer jake heron managed to fight off a four metre great white at the same beach 10 years ago which attacked him just 10 metres from shore by punching and kicking it  he escaped with 20 stitches in his arm and 40 stitches in his thigh jake heron was mauled by a fourmetre great white in 2005  wildcatch fisheries sa chairman jonas woolford said the number of shark sightings in the area had risen recently there has been a number of sightings just recently actually at a number of locations along the coast near to fishery bay just around the corner the sightings have said that the sharks have been rather aggressive actually mr woolford told the abc its been reported that there hasnt been many for about 10 or so weeks so whether those ones that have been

            "he said the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats thats why it is so urgent that the countries of europe adopt very strong policies that will end the peoplesmuggling trade across the mediterranean conservative mr abbott won power in 2013 on a stop the boats pledge and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months operation sovereign borders involves the australian navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from mr abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the united nations over australias obligations to refugees saying his policy was the most decent most compassionate solution in the mediterranean callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by european nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back last year italy scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives but the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions eu leaders including david cameron are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a life or death summit to solve the problem save the children warned that 2500 youngsters could die in the mediterranean this year chief executive justin forsyth said eu leaders hold the lives of thousands of desperate people in their hands when they meet with every day that they prevaricate and delay restarting search and rescue operations the risk grows that more people will die taken to safety an unknown survivor of the mediterranean migrant tragedy is wheeled off an italian coastguard ship in the sicilian city of catania  horror a man carries

chaos video footage shows a large wooden doublemasted boat with people packed on board just metres away from the greek island of rhodes in the eastern mediterranean sea  migrant boats approaching australian waters are turned back by the navy or sometimes even towed back to where they came from any vessels which manage to get close are taken under naval escort to the pacific islands of nauru or papua new guinea where they are detained while migrants asylum claims are processed migrants are then matched with a country that will resettle them those detained on nauru are sent to cambodia which is paid to take them by the australian government a similar arrangement exists with papua new guinea for those detained there any migrants who actually make it to australia by sea are automatically blocked from staying  even if they are found to be genuine refugees the controversial scheme  which began 18 months ago has been attacked by human rights advocates who say it violates australias international obligations however the government says it has greatly reduced the number of illegal immigrants arriving on australian shores yesterday mr cameron pledged the uk would make a contribution to search and rescue operations foreign secretary philip hammond said refugees also needed to be persuaded to stay in their home countries in the first place weve got to start in the upstream countries weve got to deal with the traffickers he said adding he absolutely supported a more formidable operation on the sea ed miliband said the governments policy of leaving people to drown had been wrong the labour leader said frankly i think it is a stain on europe to have these things happening weve got to act on search and rescue and that is about basic humanity and obviously we must do whatever we can to help the humanitarian response he said one of the architects of australias tough border policies retired army majorgeneral jim molan said european leaders were guilty of incompetence mr molan said the tragedies were worsened by europes refusal to learn from its own mistakes and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems in the mediterranean the tide of human misery has only worsened saturdays disaster was the most catastrophic in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1700 lives this year  30 times higher than the same period

the mediterranean australian pm tony abbott  who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach australia  said the eu should urgently follow his lead his hardline policy has

            "so what we are seeing is that the water seeps down through the soil over time other salts may also dissolve in the soil and now that they are liquid they can move and precipitate elsewhere under the surface observations by the mars probes stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing running water with a depth of up to one metre now the new closeup images taken by the rover all the way en route to mount sharp show that there are expanses of sedimentary deposits lying as plates one above the other and leaning a bit toward mount sharp evidence of water on mars dates back to the mariner 9 mission which arrived in 1971 it revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys mars is currently in the middle of an ice age and before this study scientists believed liquid water could not exist on its surface in june 2013 curiosity found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on mars in september of the same year the first scoop of soil analysed by curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight last month scientists provided the best estimates for water on mars claiming it once had more liquid h2 than the arctic ocean  and the planet kept these oceans for more than 15 billion years the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on mars to thrive but over the last 37 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water  leaving it barren and dry dr madsen said these kind of deposits are formed when large amounts of water flow down the slopes of the crater and these streams of water meet the stagnant water in the form of a lake however he added that it is not likely that life will be found on mars as it is too dry too cold and the cosmic radiation is so powerful that it penetrates at least one metre into the surface and kills all life  at least life as we know it on earth the finding however could make it easier for humans to live on mars in the future he explains that about 45 billion years ago mars had 65 times as much water as it does now and a thicker atmosphere but most of this water has disappeared out into space and the reason is that mars no longer has global magnetic fields which we have on earth observations by the mars probes stereo camera have previously shown areas characteristic of old riverbed with rounded pepples that clearly show that a long time ago there was flowing running water with a depth of up to one metre currents of liquid iron in the earths interior generate the magnetic fields and they act as a shield that protects us from cosmic radiation the magnetic field protects the earths atmosphere against degradation from energy rich particles from the sun but mars no longer has a global magnetic field and this means that the atmosphere is not protected from radiation from the sun so the solar particles protons simply shoot the atmosphere out into space little by little the red planet might still have liquid water suggests information collected by nasas curiosity rover researchers have long known that there is water in the form of ice on mars now new information from the mars rover curiosity published in the journal nature shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet the hidden valley in gale crater on mars very finegrained sediments which slowly fell down through the water were deposited right at the bottom of the crater lake the sediment plates at the bottom are level so everything indicates that the entire gale crater may have been a large lake new information from nasas mars rover curiosity published in the journal nature shows that it is possible that there is liquid water close to the surface of the red planet the explanation is that the substance perchlorate has been found in the soil which lowers the freezing point so the water does not freeze into ice but is liquid and present in very salty water curiosity detected salts called perchlorates which can absorb water from the atmosphere and turn it into briny liquid when night falls some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid curiosity landed on mars in 2012 in the large crater gale located just south of the equator the giant crater is 154 kilometres in diameter and the rim of the crater is almost five kilometres high in the middle of the crater lies the mountain mount sharp curiosity has travelled more than 10km from the landing site towards mount sharp and has carried out many studies along the way doctor morten bo madsen associate professor and head of the mars group at the niels bohr institute at the university of copenhagen in denmark said we have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and under the right conditions it absorbs water vapour from the atmosphere our measurements from the curiosity rovers weather monitoring station show that these conditions exist at night and just after sunrise in the winter based on measurements of humidity and the temperature at a height of 16 metres and at the surface of the planet we can estimate the amount of water that is absorbed when night falls some of the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on the planet surface as frost but calcium perchlorate is very absorbent and it forms a brine with the water so the freezing point is lowered and the frost can turn into a liquid researchers say that gale crater was once a giant lake on the red planet  the soil is porous\n",

them closer to safety matt smith centre was unable to continue his good goalscoring form for the cottagers  the goal is a blatant handball by mccormack rotherham assistant paul raynor fumed we dominated possession and created a number of opportunities you hope somethings going to fall for us one thing that can never be labelled against our team is a lot of character and desire thats the minimum we expect were enjoying the challenge and had a difficult week a good word to use is defiance symons added ive seen the goal again and theres probably an element of doubt but id expect them to have a moan about it the goal gave the whole place a lift smith unfortunate not to win a penalty after craig morgans shove and substitute tim hoogland thumped a header over when unmarked at the back post oddly one point may have been three but that wouldve merely masked glaring deficiencies for all the talk of difficulties staying in the division is the only thing that matters time for fulham to press reset and start again\n",

debate since it came to  the worlds attention in 1934 scientists have widely written off the idea as a modernday myth with continued sightings claimed to be set ups and wishful thinking but it has remained a contested phenomenon for 81 years perhaps the most famous picture of  nessie was taken by colonel robert kenneth wilson a london gynaecologist it  was published in the daily mail on 21 april 1934 and showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water however  it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from woolworths with a head  and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by biggame hunter marmaduke  wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him  over his hapless search for the beast the  earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of loch ness appears in  the life of st columba by adomnán written in the 7th century st  columba an irish monk had sent a disciple into the loch to prove  there was nothing there but the monster rose and chased the man  snapping at his heels but it fled in terror as if pulled back by ropes when st columba made the sign of the cross and commanded go no further do not touch the man go back at once in november 1933 hugh gray was the first to picture a creature splashing in the water four  stumpylooking objects on the bottom of the creatures body appeared to  look like appendages such as flippers but it was later suggested the  creature was a dog possibly holding a stick in 1938 g e taylor a south african tourist filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16mm colour film his picture was declared positive evidence by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist in 1960 aeronautical engineer tim dinsdale filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake mr dinsdale allegedly spotted the animal on  his last day hunting for it and described the object as reddish with a  blotch on its side in may 2007 gordon holmes a  55yearold lab technician captured video of what he said

            "i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill using the power of genomics and computational biology we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab by studying gene expression the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and based on the types of changes we might see clues as to how the crabs respond although we are still in the early stages of our research we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure  meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce its not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be longterm effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill this not only has consequences for the gulf area where oil drilling continues but also for communities along the atlantic coast where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration bps vice president of communications geoff morrell told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have bounced back and there is no data that suggests there are any longterm populationlevel impacts to any species with the virtual certainty of more spills we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently the us department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress in coming months they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill but government agencies cannot just rely on the shortterm data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis instead the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing longterm ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what normal looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources its still unclear where all of the oil went exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab crabs play an important role in the region roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the gulf in 2012 earning tens of millions in revenue yet in the aftermath of the spill changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye researchers documented substantial differences in appearance and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints forcing limbs to fall off these traits have affected not only the crabs market value but also likely their ability to survive while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the shortterm the health of these crabs could still be precarious cnnfive years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nations history we are still experiencing  yet only beginning to truly understand  its profound environmental and economic repercussions the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented with declines in tourism and the seafood industry as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region since then the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery in fact reports indicate that the gulf of mexicos seafood industry which supplies the united states with roughly 40 of its seafood is finally starting to rebound however profound challenges remain in part because so many questions about the longterm consequences remain unanswered to this day\n",

            "the oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 15 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in ileret northwest kenya have now found a total of 99 prints they now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time  perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud the distinct tracks found at ileret in kenya like the one above are the oldest human footprints in the world  it provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints  homo erectus  were sophisticated hunters while their ancestors before them may have eaten meat they scavenged or from small prey they were able to catch hunting parties suggests homo erectus went after larger prey early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago a new study has suggested research by dr neil roach has shown that the that the skeletons of homo erectus had shoulders and collar bones that would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully this would have enabled homo erectus to become a proficient hunter able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey dr neil roach a palaeoanthropologist at the american museum of natural history in new york who led the study said the prints appeared to have been made by adult males he said that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest speaking to nature dr roach said what we can say is that we have a number of individuals probably males that are moving across a lake shore in a way that is consistent with how carnivores move the researchers who presented their findings at the annual meeting of the paleoanthropology society in san francisco hope to test their conclusions by studying the movement patterns of modern day subsistence hunters in africa the tracks in ileret were first revealed in 2009 after researchers at bournemouth university and rutgers koobi fora field school in kenya announced they had discovered a collection of 22 human prints this deep print appears to have been left by a male homo erectus that may have been part of a hunting party  analysis of the print tracks above showed they had been made by a early human that walked much like we do  the prints were preserved in sediment that had once been the shoreline of an ancient lake alongside the human prints were those of birds including storks pelicans as well as crocodiles antelope hippos bovids and other predators professor matthew bennett who was part of the team that originally studied the footprints is shown above crouching in front of the ancient human tracks  analysis of the footprints by professor matthew bennett at bournemouth university revealed the human prints had been made by a species with a similar bipedal stance and gait to modern humans with a pronounced arch and short toes he concluded that the prints had probably been left by homo erectus  an extinct species of early human that disappeared around 200000 years ago they were among the longest surviving of all the human species  surviving for around 15 million years there is some evidence that they may have also been able to control fire and cooked food footprints this old are extremely rare as they tend to erode away in a few thousand years but are also valuable as they can give clues about behaviour dr roach and his colleagues decided to study the prints in more detail in order to get a snapshot of the life led by homo erectus over a four year excavation period a total of 483 prints in the ileret sediment have now been uncovered  99 of which were human unlike the grasseating antelope and other hooved tracks preserved in the stone  whose tracks led from grasslands to the shore  the human prints all walked in one direction along the shoreline this matched the behaviour of other hunting animals whose prints were also preserved previous work by dr roach has also shown that homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter homo erectus shown in the reconstruction above may have hunted large prey in groups or hunting parties  fossilised skeletons how their shoulders and collar bones would have allowed them to throw sticks or spears both accurately and powerfully dr roach said theres starting to be a consensus that around 2 million years ago we see more carnivory that has to do with hunting curtis marean a palaeoanthropologist at arizona state university in tempe said it was hard to tell from the prints exactly what had made them he told nature it could be a group hunt but it could also be lake shore foraging tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution scientists say the highquality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children meaning that human communities grew faster according to researchers from lund university in sweden the research compared 67 species of mammals including humans apes mice and killer whales and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning they found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores eating meat enabled the breastfeeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened according tot he researchers among natural fertility societies the average duration of breastfeeding is 2 years and 4 months this is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species around 120 years it is even less if compared to our closest relatives female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years\n",

            "as seasons go this one has been pretty close to perfect for bristol city runaway leaders in sky bet league one they became the first team in the football league to mathematically secure promotion on tuesday night  and in sensational style hitting bradford city for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line although given their freewheeling and freescoring form the result really came as little surprise aden flint celebrates with a bottle of sky bet champagne following bristol citys promotion  city players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from league one  and theres more add to that their memorable johnstones paint trophy victory at wembley last month  when walsall were comfortably beaten 20 in the final  and you have a truly historic campaign for steve cotterills team the season has been a personal triumph for tall tattooed defender aden flint who has played a central role in returning city to the championship after two seasons away his uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from setpieces leading to 11 goals this season flint was on target at wembley fulfilling a childhood dream in the process and also at valley parade on tuesday the robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against bradford city on tuesday  flint scores his sides fourth goal of the game as city earn an impressive 60 at valley parade  when the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season we had three aims he tells sportsmail the first was to win promotion back to the championship the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the johnstones paint trophy weve managed to do two of the three and hopefully on saturday we can achieve the other thats because city need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions the 25yearold defender celebrates as the robins earned promotion to the championship in style  city manager steve cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne  they currently lead preston north end by 10 points but the lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against coventry city at ashton gate this weekend nobody wants that runnersup medal the aim was always to go up as champions and were close to achieving that flint says weve had that winning habit and its a good one to get in to weve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing seldom does one team dominate a division in this way the lowest city have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture the robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the johnstones paint trophy  once again flint right made a huge contribution giving city the lead against walsall on march 22  flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory  cotterill left and jay emmanuelthomas look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at wembley  they kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn since september 13th there has only been one week when they havent been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the new year not that success has been reserved for the league they reached the fourth round of the fa cup losing narrowly to premier league west ham and claimed the trophy too in front of over 40000 of their fans at wembley flint said i think any player dreams of scoring and winning at wembley there really isnt a better feeling in football it is right up there with the highlights in my career but i would say that if we win on saturday and go up as champions that will push wembley out the defenders goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but hes quick to credit his teammates for the service i didnt expect to score as many as five to be honest flint holds the jpt with pride as he celebrates the 20 victory against walsall last month  the defender was also named the sky bet league 1 player of the month for march ive just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those setpieces that have been delivered by the lads aaron wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season luke freeman and marlon pack have been providing plenty of assists not just for me but for everyone but everyone has chipped in it has been a collective effort the team spirit here has been the best ive ever experienced and its been an enjoyable season promotion back to the championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the clubs 118year history aaron wilbraham right has scored 18 domestic goals for the highflying robins this season  billionaire owner steve lansdown left is funding a renovation of the clubs ashton gate home  billionaire owner steve lansdown who made his fortune in financial services is funding a renovation of the clubs ashton gate home to expand the capacity to 27000 and make it premier leagueready and according to flint thats precisely where the club is aiming we aim high and should be in the championship if not higher than that its a massive city and maybe we can change that the chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that seeing bournemouth and brentford doing so well in the championship nobody expected that and who knows what will happen when we get there next season\n",

            "a surrender order issued by hitlers successor in the final days of the second world war that was found on the chief of the luftwaffe when he was arrested is being auctioned 70 years later for 21000 the typed dispatch  owned by a us collector  was sent by german president karl doenitz on may 8 1945 telling officers to abandon fighting or face the allies wrath it was seized from luftwaffe chief robert von greim when he was arrested that day the wwi fighter ace then killed himself rather than be tortured by the russians the surrender order that is being auctioned is being auctioned by bonhams new york  the typed order sent by german president karl doenitz is expected to fetch 21000 when it goes under the hammer  grand admiral doenitz had been hitlers choice to replace him as leader of the nazis a role he assumed following the dictators suicide on april 30 but a week later amid a crumbling and defeated reich doenitz met with allied commanders to sign the instrument of surrender bringing an end to war in europe the following day doenitz who had been commander of the german navy up until hitlers death sent a telex message to his commanders in the field informing them of the immediate surrender to save as many people as possible for germany describing the action as unavoidable doenitz instructed officers to abandon all fighting or face the wrath of the allies the note read on 7 may 1945 0241 the supreme command of the wehrmacht signed the unconditional surrender of all armed forces on land on water and in the air to the supreme command of the allied expeditionary forces as well as the soviet supreme command this was unavoidable in order to prevent the complete destruction of certain parts of the front which was expected to occur in a short time and in doing so to save as many people as possible for germany accordingly on 9 may 1945 0100 gst every ongoing combat activity must be abandoned all officers of the army navy and the luftwaffe as well as troops of the wehrmacht divisions and the waffen ss shall remain in their current positions effective immediately no maritime vehicle or aeroplane shall be sunk or destroyed no military equipment may be damaged in any way he finished the message with a stark warning that if his officers do not act according to the conditions of surrender the command of the allied expeditionary forces and soviet command will undertake punitive measures or other steps beyond the conditions of surrender von greim 52 a wwi fighter ace had been put in charge of the luftwaffe after hitler turned on herman goering accusing him of treason railing against his former comrades hitler summoned von greim to berlin and ordered him to hunt down and kill gestapo chief heinrich himmler who he believed had tried to harbour a peace deal with the allies the order was seized from luftwaffe chief robert von greim when he was arrested that day  von greim escaped berlin in a camouflaged plane and his actions thereafter are unknown until he was arrested in austria by us troops on may 8 on his arrest von greim admitted to his captors i am the head of the luftwaffe but i have no luftwaffe he was taken to salzburg and was due to be handed over to the soviets but committed suicide by taking a cyanide pill on may 24 the note is one of the only copies of doenitzs dispatch known to exist today it is tipped to fetch 21000 when it goes under the hammer at bonhams auction house on behalf of a private collector from the us tom lamb an expert in military history at bonhams said the story behind this document is an incredible one hitler was in his bunker in berlin a few days prior to his death and he called von greim one of his closest and most trusted allies von greim was flown in to berlin amid all the fighting that evening hitler launched a rant about how his right hand man heinrich himmler had betrayed him hitler ordered von greim to go and kill himmler for treason then take control of the luftwaffe following the treason of goering von greim left immediately in his camouflaged plane and amazingly managed to escape out of berlin without being caught he was supposed to go to plon in northern germany to track down himmler but he was arrested on may 8 the same day as the german surrender by us troops in austria hitler had committed suicide a week earlier and admiral doenitz had taken charge on may 7 1945 doenitz had signed the instrument of surrender and the following day he sent his high command a dispatch informing them doenitz warned that if the germans didnt stop fighting they would be killed by the americans or the russians he understood the end had come and he was telling his high command to make sure everyone knew that the telegram from doenitz was found on von griem when he was arrested von greim was then taken to salzburg where he was due to be part of a sovietus prisoner exchange but fearing torture at the hands of stalin he took his own life with a cyanide pill copies of the surrender note from doenitz are exceptionally rare  many were lost or destroyed but somehow this one survived this document is incredibly important in the history of the 20th century the auction will take place in new york on april 29\n",

            "whether its a chocolate bar that no longer satisfies your appetite or washing powder which now runs out before your next shop many of our big brands are shrinking their products the latest casualty are boxes of cadburys fingers which it was announced yesterday will contain two fewer chocolate fingers from now on they join creme eggs pg tips teabags and even john west tuna in the everincreasing list of goods getting smaller scroll down for video  shape changer the rounded chunks look nice  but they give you 14 per cent less dairy milk chocolate  even if maths isnt your cup of tea its easy to see youre now getting fewer tea bags per pack of blend of both  good old bessie not so  shes nicked 50g of your homestyle chips that are cooked in a crispy batter but while it may be better for your waistline its not better for your pocket if manufacturers and supermarkets dont pass on the cost saving to consumers when john west shrunk its no drain tuna steak in brine from 130g to 120g the price stayed at 1 in morrisons and there was no change in the 5 cost of surf with essential oils washing powder when it dropped from 2kg to 161kg its seemingly part of a strategy across the retail industry that enables manufacturers to increase profits without putting up prices and thus risk losing customers its now so common its even got a name shrinkflation in its latest issue consumer watchdog which reveals a host of products that have been shrunk from surf washing powder and cif spray to hovis best of both bread while the price remains the same shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices dont consumers will feel angry that they are being shortchanged by some of their favourite brands says which executive director richard lloyd its time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stop people from comparing products to find the cheapest its fiendishly difficult to compare prices properly nowadays because special offers mean they change frequently indeed very often a negative story about a product shrinking in the media will lead to its price magically shrinking for example after being featured in which this month because it had dropped from 750ml to 700ml but stayed at the same 2 price in asda the supermarket giant discounted cif actifizz lemon multi purpose spray to 175 f ood industry commentator martin isark believes the shrinking ploy is becoming more widespread its now common practice among the big confectioners and their argument is that they reduce the size so they dont have to put the prices up he says pingpong prices going up and down almost daily confuse the shopper so the brands can reduce the size without the customer ever realising most of us buy on price which is why they get away with this other confectionery goods that have gone the same way as cadburys fingers include mars bars down from an original bumper 58g to 48g since 2013 kit kat chunky down from 48g to 40g earlier this year and in 2011 the tins of cadburys roses chocolates shrank from 975g to 850g the equivalent loss of 11 chocolates sometimes changes are obvious such as cadbury altering the shape of its chocolate on other occasions the clues are more subtle  a pasta sauce taking less time to warm suggests you are getting less of it the new version of tescos tomato and mascarpone sauce is a minute quicker to cook  as you get 25g less  whoever heard of a pack of five eggs it seems cadbury has when it controversially took an egg out the box  angus kennedy editor of trade magazine kennedys confection says one of the worst examples of shrinkflation was cadburys reducing the number of creme eggs in a box from halfadozen to five in the runup to easter both sizes cost 1 at iceland if these companies said were sorry but we have no choice but to do this because cocoa is now in short supply 114 grams cadbury chocolate fingers have come down by 11g  the equivalent of two chocolate fingers  vince bamford buying and supply editor of the grocer says shrinkflation has taken off because suppliers are under pressure to maintain profit margins to keep shareholders happy and believe consumers prefer smaller products to price increases when we were in recession suppliers and retailers were very wary of raising prices he says but i dont think it would do them any harm to be more honest with consumers to say were having to pay 10 per cent more for our products and were having to pass some of that cost on to you  instead customers are left feeling shortchanged food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day whether thats the impact of changing utility prices or ingredient costs which can be volatile says a food and drink federation spokesperson businesses seek to offset these costs wherever possible through improvements in efficiency and productivity but these actions can only go so far and in some cases companies will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumers however its the underhand way in which these product changes appear to be introduced that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of so many then i think the british public would be much more understanding he says what we dont like is feeling duped when we realise what the companies are up to especially when theyre still paying 1 for a sharing bag of maltesers thats down from 140g to 120g in fact cadburys fingers have gone up from 1 to 150 in sainsburys this year despite the shrinkage confectionery companies have argued that a reduction in the size of their bars is not all about rising production costs but is also an attempt to support the governments drive to help people lose weight in the face of an obesity epidemic mr kennedy disputes this saying that as the bars get smaller people are likely to just buy and eat more manufacturers often claim that when they reduce the size of a product they pass on savings to shops but cannot guarantee that they will in turn bring down retail prices firms that were approached by which were unwilling to go into specifics saying the information was confidential spreading it thinly philly is down 10 per cent but at least its healthier

events in june and july but am looking forward to getting back on the track well ahead of the record attempt in september handcycling is growing in popularity and annual speed trials for a range of

of planning design and building it was great to be able to welcome liz to plymouth and to embark on the first real tests with her at the controls the tests have provided us with a lot more information and we are now fully analysing the results while lizs comments on the day are also hugely important we will be factoring all of them into our work over the coming months to ensure that we have the best possible opportunity to break the record in september a team of  experts is hoping to enter the record books by building the worlds fastest bike powered by hand engineers developed the  human

employees of the fast food chain began to protest scroll down for video  single mother adriana alvarez 22 has revealed what its really like to live on mcdonalds wages where she makes only 1050 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in chicago  alvarez pictured with her threeyearold son manny says that even with assistance from food stamps medicaid and a child care subsidy she is barely getting by despite having word for mcdonalds for five years  the mother revealed in a column for refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a decent place to live with good schools for her threeyearold son manny when it rains water steeps into the apartment alvarez writes of her basement home the only place she said she can afford this wetness brings mold and i cant get rid of the smell we cant even leave anything on the floor toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in alvarez said that after paying for child care transportation to work food rent and our other basic expenses she can never afford to give anything else to her son every time i think about taking manny somewhere fun like to a movie i have to think about whether we can really afford the gas she writes the mother said even providing the specific milk her son who drinks a halfgallon every two days requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle since its a more expensive brand it uses up most of the 80 alvarez is allotted in food stamps she told the new york times alvarez said her situation is not unique she said that most of her coworkers are in the same boat forced to rely on government assistance no matter how long theyve held their jobs according to one study cited in business insider half of the nations fast food workers require some kind of government assistance costing taxpayers 7billion a year alvarez is a leader with fight for 15 an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize she said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting  last year more than 100 mcdonalds employees including alvarez who were part of fight for 15 were arrested after they protested a mcdonalds shareholder meeting to demand the 15 an hour wage  and 12billion of that public assistance goes to employees of mcdonalds annually reported a study released by the national employment law project just weeks ago mcdonalds announced that it would be giving a 1 pay raise for about 90000 employees effectively making their wage 10 an hour but the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump which alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 mcdonalds employees and even for those who do get an increased wage alvarez argues that the number would hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty and higher wages arent all alvarez and her coworkers are fighting for she said fight for 15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union without interference from management a group of protesters in new york stage a diein as part of a day of rallies and protests by fastfood workers known as fight for 15 on april 15 fight for 15 pictured protesting on wednesday started two years ago in new york when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after thanksgiving  alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days which she said she is currently not provided with costing her a days worth of wages

week to initiate the same change but alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon it doesnt seem right that people who work with children or who serve food arent paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table she writes we want our families to be able to look forward to a better future there has been some change seattle and san francisco have raised the minimum

the eagerly anticipated wearable may want to snap up an apple watch on holiday because britain is the most expensive place in the world to buy one the most expensive edition model costs up to 2500 more in the uk compared to elsewhere in the world while at the lower end of the scale british buyers pay up to 63 more for the sport model britain is the most expensive place in the world in buy the apple watch the three models are pictured above the sport shown left is round 63 more expensive in the uk than the us and there is a difference in price of over 1230 when it comes to the luxurious watch edition right the gadget is available to preorder in nine countries the cheapest model is the 38mm sport version and costs 299 in the uk in the us the same model costs 349 but this doesnt include sales tax sales tax in the us depends on the region where the product is sold but as an example california has one of the highest rates  at 9  while montana has zero with both of these sales taxes added to the price of the sports model in the us the total cost works out at 38041 257 and 349 236 in the respective states this is a difference of 42 when bought in california compared to the uk and 63 when compared to montana the effect is magnified for the topoftherange edition version which costs from 8000 for the 38mm model in britain compared to a starting price of 10000 in the us at the time of writing 10000 converts to 6769  which equates to a difference of 1231 before charges are taken into account the most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the uk is 13500 in the uk and 17000 in the us when sales taxes are added to the us model the price rises to 18530 in california which converts to 12543  a difference of 957 all prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region prices also include all relevant sales taxes beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in gbp in the us california was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9 while montana was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it doesnt have a sales tax quebec in canada has one of the highest sales taxes at 15 while alberta has one of the lowest at 5 prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing but the difference isnt just visible between the uk and us in australia for example the most expensive 38mm edition costs 21000 aud which converts to 10832  a difference of around 2665 compared to the uk in fact during mailonline investigations the uk price for all three models of the watch in both sizes with all sales taxes included still works out more expensive in all the other regions where the watch is currently available for preorder the only places the watch works out cheaper in the uk is when its compared to the most expensive 42mm edition model in australia and china or the 38mm edition in quebec and china explaining the price differences apple told mailonline uk prices include vat us prices dont include sales tax sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the  tax rate which varies widely by jurisdiction and ranges from zero to around 15 per cent in canada the gadget is now available in nine countries with the cheapest model  the 38mm sport version costing 299 in the uk here apple watch fans in beijing looking at the devices behind glass and on a display stand  the

16000  garden arena capacity  100000  people expected for the event  170000  square feet of gaming  a convoy of trucks is already delivering the first consignments of half a million bottles of budweiser miller lite corona and tecate who are paying more than 5million 33m to be one of the fights sponsors many early arrivals are busy now stockpiling cases of their preferred foaming nectar in their rooms at the hotel which will cost them 1600 1057 a night come friday and saturday even at those prices they are the lucky ones the majority of rooms on the strip are reserved for proven highrollers with track records of sevenfigure gambling sibella says we are taking care of major clients from all over the world many latecomers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens sibella expects 50000 people to set foot in the mgm each day for fridays weighin and saturdays main event itself in addition to the near 14000 occupants of the 7000 rooms and suites merchandise for the fight on sale at the mgm grand with just days to go before the blockbuster event  a hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten american mayweather  the hotel is putting the finishing touches on its preparations for the biggest event in las vegas history  who do you think will win the fight between floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao who do you think will win the fight between floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao now share your opinion  a hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the grand garden arena all this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the mgm grand and the groups 13 other hotelcasinos on the strip in its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca vegas now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation restaurants bars and shows than it does from betting sibella says at an event like this we want to maximise all our nongaming revenue nevertheless the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on new years eve and equalled for mike tysons biggest fights projections for the economic impact on the vegas economy have been revised upwards from an initial 400m 265m to well over a billion dollars this is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the megarich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years the mgm has an army of 9000 employees almost two to every three hotel guests many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious mayweathers fight against pacquiao will take place at the mgm grands 16000capacity garden arena  fewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately  as well as being a hotel the mgm grand is a worldfamous resort with casinos and entertainment  it is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in las vegas history but ask sibella for his greatest concern and he says the safety of all these people fights this big bring special risks there will be a melting pot of thousands of mayweathers fellow american rappers and almost as many filipino immigrants supporting pacquiao but it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts a number of fight nights at the grand garden have ended in pushing shoving and nearcrushing among the crowds as they tried to leave fortunately there have been no fatalities but after mayweathers most recent fight here against marcos maidana a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment after the last stampede as sibella describes it he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control a grand king room which on monday was being sold on the website for over 1800 for the night of the fight  the mgm resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of its entertainment experience  gambling is a huge source of revenue for most las vegas hotels including the mgm grand  the two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous resorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but sibella is putting safety first although the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticketholders and those with restaurant or bar reservations the problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the peoplewatchers blocking their movement says sibella we are now working on opening up more exit routes furthermore this saturday the rubberneckers will be kept at a distance they will be further discouraged by the celebrities  sports stars and hollywood royalty among them  using a private guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng metal detectors have been obligatory since tysons infamous earbiting fight against evander holyfield spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon mayweathers last 10 fights have all taken place at the mgm grand including two against marcos maidana  the unbeaten american beat ricky hatton at the mgm grand in december 2007  hatton was also on the end of another devastating defeat by pacquiao at the mgm grand in may 2009  sibella says like floyd and manny we need a perfect game plan more than 50000 of the outoftowners will be syphoned away from the arena hotspot to watch closedcircuit tv transmission on giant screens located in all the mgm properties even that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost 150 99 a ticket for the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weighin  at the arena on friday  to facilitate crowd control for that event proceeds  at 10 a head  will go to charities nominated by mayweather and pacquiao come saturday mgm corporate security the las vegas police and nevada state troopers will make a coordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the strip mayweather beat oscar de la hoya at the mgm grand in 2007 in a fight that set payperview records  those travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra dropoff and pickup points tysons fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but sibella expects mayweather and pacquiao to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion he says the styles of floyd and manny should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype if its the great fight i expect it will help create the happy night we all want just for the record most of we lucky 1500 journalists out of 18000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena no beer or any other alcohol allowed\n",

            "manager arsene wenger is convinced something is finally happening at arsenal again  and everyone can smell it the gunners romped to a 41 win over liverpool at the emirates stadium in saturdays lunchtime kickoff which was a seventh successive barclays premier league victory and moved them up into second place while manchester city could reclaim second by beating crystal palace on monday and the title looks out of reach as chelsea remain seven points ahead with a match in hand there is no doubt when wenger has all of his squad available arsenal are capable of giving anyone a run for their money right back hector bellerin gave arsenal the lead with a superb leftfoot curling into the corner to get things going at the emirates stadium  bellerin broke the emirates deadlock for arsenal cutting in from his native righthand side and curling a leftfoot strike into the corner  although there was disappointment at failure to progress in europe following elimination by monaco the prospect of an improved league finish and successful fa cup defence remains very much on the agenda wenger who was often criticised over the direction of his team following almost a decade without a trophy feels finally things are starting to come together we have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team he said there is something happening that shows you that they are ready to fight for each other mesut ozil is congratulated by his teammates after his magnificent freekick on the half hour mark put arsenal fully in control of the game  you can see that you cant cheat on that people smell that it of course is a good basis and defensively we are getting better following a poor start to the campaign arsenal were expected to struggle to sustain a place in the top four wenger though will not get complacent i am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look but what is true is that its in our hands how well we deal with the situation now will be important he said alexis sanchez celebrates with olivier giroud after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area made it 30 to arsenal in the first half  wenger has his sights set on getting as close to chelsea as possible with the leaders set to come to the emirates stadium on april 26 so i would say that it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and level of urgency between now and the end of the season after failing to make the most of their positive start on saturday arsenal had to soak up some pressure from liverpool with raheem sterling failing to capitalise when put in on goal a huge flag is waved as nacho monreal and giroud are among the first teammates to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer  the gunners finally broke the deadlock through the unlikely source of fullback hector bellerin who slotted home a fine leftfoot curling effort on 37 minutes it proved the catalyst for an onslaught with mesut ozils freekick and a rocket by alexis sanchez on the stroke of halftime effectively ending the contest after arsenals tempo dropped liverpool reduced the arrears with a penalty from jordan henderson but following the dismissal of emre can for a second yellow card olivier giroud cracked home a late fourth to cap a memorable afternoons work sanchez got in on the goalscoring act just before halftime finding space outside the box to smash a drive over the head of keeper mignolet  wenger admits he has been impressed by the workrate of both bellerin and defensive midfielder francis coquelin who were each drafted into the firstteam as cover for injury but are now an integral part of the side asked if either man was in his thoughts at the start of the season wenger said honestly no but my job is to remain openminded and make decisions when you have to i picked bellerin against liverpool because of his pace i thought daniel sturridge would play and then sterling would have gone on the flank francis coquelin challenges daniel sturridge during the barclays premier league match  at emirates stadium  because of his low centre of gravity sterling changes direction very quickly and hector is short as well wenger added i think you also have to give credit to players who get less such as coquelin in the first half he broke up many attacks in a convincing way but honestly i couldnt say that in my head at the start of the season coquelin was one of the firstchoice players\n",

best guess for what that amazing speed might need to look like cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80 to 90 by 2050 said jennifer morgan global director of the climate program at the world resources institute it depends on how much risk you want to accept she said some activists including those from 350org and avaaz which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in new york want to accept less risk than that our position is 100 clean energy said david sievers a senior campaigner for avaaz if we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury scarier still we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100 some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2degree target saying its too ambitious or even naive but we need a yardstick to measure progress  and we need that north star to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem if you think 2 degrees sounds bad 5 degrees is far far worse the ipcc expects a 5degree world to be characterized by major extinctions around the globe and a reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide just beyond that at 6 degrees were looking a catastrof that would be almost infinitely costly said wagner the environmental defense fund economist its akin to killing the planet basically or society on the planet this much should be clear something has to change if we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3 thats still better or less awful than 5 or 6 whats important is that we maintain a sense of urgency and keep

environmental defense fund and coauthor of the book climate shock think super droughts rising seas and mass extinctions yet for all of its importance i dont think the 2degree threshold is as famous as

together but below youll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number many of them come straight from you the readers encourage you to sign up for the 2 degrees newsletter and feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below theyll shape the way i spend the rest of the year reporting on this supercritical number one guy it turns out william nordhaus an economist at yale nordhaus 73 proposed the 2degree threshold in a 1977 1977 paper titled economic growth and climate the carbon dioxide problem the estimate was crude but it was a reasonable first start he told me if there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years he wrote in the climate casino a growing body of research now supports the idea science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming and that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2degree world is something none of us should want you need a judgment call for these things said carlo jaeger chair of the global climate forum who has written on the history of 2 degrees celsius and this 2degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal

have up epiphany said glyn above is an it specialist who spends his weekends playing his bagpipes to the masses  this is not the end of the project its actually just the beginning of what we want to achieve its exciting that its going beyond us and inviting people into the experience of storytelling she said after a year on the road interviewing a cross section of the world epiphany and carl said their experience taught them so much about how to relate to other people once we realised that we are all essentially the same in so many ways the world became a much friendlier place looking at the ways we are the same rather than the ways that we are different means there are so many ways of problem solving and helping one another epiphany said it was something we had a sense of at the beginning of the trip and was reinforced as we connected with 365 different people all over the world she said the big message we want to share is compassion over hate while throwing in the ninetofive life is a dream for many one young couple decided to make it a reality experiencing the world as they spent a year filming one mini documentary a day sydney couple epiphany morgan and carl mason produced 365 documentaries in as many days visiting 35 countries and 70 cities as part of their project 365 docobites an idea which even the couple originally doubted would actually work the idea only popped into my head about seven months before we hopped on the plane when i first told one of my friends what we were thinking of doing she asked whether i was sure it was a good idea epiphany told daily mail australia scroll down for video  epiphany morgan and carl mason produced 365 documentaries in 365 days while travelling to 35 countries  with only seven months to organise everything epiphany 23 left her job at a film production company to freelance and work towards their dream while carl 27 continued to work as a senior editor at an advertising agency when we told our friends and family what we were planning on doing they didnt really believe us they kept asking are you sure youre going to be able to do that carl said honestly i didnt even believe we were going until about month before we left when epiphany told me that everything was in order for us to leave he said with a strict budget of 40 a day the couple set off to their first destination the us and landed in new york to begin their very long journey across the globe i can remember the first day we were in times square with all our camera gear and  we didnt get up the courage to ask a single person to be involved carl said it was a bit rainy and when it stopped raining we told ourselves it was too dark and then it was oh we havent eaten so we kept finding an out he said the couple began their filming journey in new york and visited 70 cities in their year of filming  both epiphany and carl have a background in film carl worked as a senior editor at an advertising agency and epiphany worked at a production company before going freelance  the pair from sydney set themselves a goal of releasing one mini documentary each day for a year but we always managed to get them out there were a couple of funny moments where we would be madly dashing around trying to upload a film he said there was this one moment where we were in new orleans and the film was in the middle of uploading on the free wifi of a cafe and they kicked us out because they were closing we had to run down the street as it was raining with the laptop open underneath a poncho trying to find another cafe with internet the couple said that the stress and pressure was worth it to experience so much of the world and to meet so many people who were willing to share their stories we learnt millions of lessons and every week there was at least one life lesson overall the biggest thing for me was that we are all human and we share the same basic needs and wants epiphany said galen the dog is eight years old and has a talent for playing dead his owner nolan uses his ability to busk in the streets  titus  mario are ambulance drivers or emts who work 13hour days in new orleans  justin devon and bailey left to right are homeless and have banded together as a family of their own making decided to live on the streets after being kicked out of the scientologist church  the pair said they learnt to not just observe but also engage with peoples lives to be vulnerable themselves if they were asking the same of others there was this one guy in ireland we interviewed he was with a group in a park who were doing this improvisational dance where they connected by touching each other epiphany said we did a documentary on one of the guys\n",

            "however it was leicester who took the lead in the 19th minute anthony knockaerts tricks out wide enabled him to cross for panayiotou the highlyrated st kitts and nevis international who powered home it would be harsh to blame evans for the goal but panayiotou was his man and he will feel he should have done better in response united went close through januzaj who shot wide from distance while joel pereira had to do well to push leicester midfielder jak mccourts effort around the post the visitors started to press with adam smiths save keeping out a wilson effort van persie who was an unused sub at chelsea on saturday had been virtually anonymous in the opening half an hour with few touches of the ball but he played his part in the leveller laying the ball off for sean goss who burst through the leicester defence and finished well on 32 minutes louis van gaal was hit by another injury when rafael was forced off just before the break with an apparent rib injury after an aerial collision with knockaert rafael looks in pain as leicesters knockaert checks on the brazilian defender during the first half of the draw at the king power stadium  rafael had to be replaced by liam grimshaw shortly before the halftime interval despite managing to get back onto his feet  manchester united winger adnan januzaj was also taken off with an injury during the reserve encounter at leicesters king power stadium  van persie finally got his opportunity in first half stoppage time but his effort from outside the area was well saved by smith and from the resulting januzaj corner smith made an even better stop to push evans header over the bar rafaels replacement liam grimshaw saw a shot deflect wide at the start of the second half before van persies next involvement was a layoff that was intercepted by dean hammond in the area before it reached its intended target a frustrating evening of injuries for united continued when januzaj went off with what appeared to be a leg injury following another seemingly innocuous aerial collision with knockaert van persie was substituted on 62 minutes going off to warm applause from all present at the king power stadium which had one side opened it may not have been the goalscoring return he wanted and indeed he looked fairly quiet but it was the game time under his belt that he needed as he looks to score the goals that would seal a champions league spot for van gaals side you would still suspect a start at everton on sunday would be far too early for van persie  but maybe not for evans the northern ireland international still had work to do late in the game as he marshalled a defence that came up against knockaert keen to force his way back into nigel pearsons plans who twice went close to finding the net a ball across the box from panayiotou also caused one or two alarms for the united back four but evans can generally be pleased with his evenings work wilson could have won it for the visitors late in the game but dragged a leftfooted effort wide under pressure from joe davis and he went in even closer deep into stoppage time as his effort was kept out by smith from kellets cross from the left januzaj awaits treatment from manchester uniteds medical staff before going off injured during the under 21 encounter robin van persie and jonny evans both enjoyed gentle reintroductions into the game as manchester uniteds under 21 side drew 11 at leicester although rafael and adnan januzaj both limped off dutch forward van persie has been out of action since february with an ankle injury after leaving swansea on crutches but he was up and running again in the east midlands helping set up uniteds goal for sean goss although his overall performance was rusty to say the least and he was replaced just after the hour defender evans has been out for six games due to suspension following his spitting incident with papiss cisse at newcastle back in march manchester united goalscorer sean

think this was part of the plan but criminals are greedy mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a mr big who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis unknown to each other acting on his inside information cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault avoiding security doors the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door at 923pm on the thursday just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend a redhaired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left the men wearing highvisibility jackets and hard hats carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ftthick vault wall on good friday at 751am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls tools and the bins now believed to be filled with diamonds cash and jewellery the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off at 1017pm on saturday the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes from 546am on sunday the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van they then loaded up the van and drove off at 644am in total 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel or that they are part of the pink panther gang from the balkans scotland yard was branded as incompetent last week after admitting it got a call at 020am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east but instead of acting on it deemed it no police response required a police spokesman said the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd the call was recorded and transferred to the polices computer system a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required he added we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call this investigation is being carried out locally it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and drilling noises a police spokesman declined to comment meanwhile a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary kim rose a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid the 58yearold made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims where were the gang from speculation over the gangs origin has been feverish possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters or that they are members of the socalled pink panther gang from the balkans who have carried out robberies across europe however the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past which was not the case here an accomplice on the inside the men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key furthermore there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the companys premises indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises loot smuggled out of the country some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market whoever their buyer it is agreed by police former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country  and probably very soon after the raid according to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend getting the goods out of the country would be a doddle what about the king of diamonds a criminal mastermind known as the king of diamonds was named last week among the prime suspects the only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridges graff diamond store in 2007 the panama hatwearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeurdriven bentley he and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with 13million worth of jewellery but i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time former bank robber noel razor smith  who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career  believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial breakin when they realised their robbery had not been discovered mr smith speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils but the rewards outweighed the danger on saturday night police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation the pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in londons diamond district described as highly audacious by metropolitan police detectives the men  wearing adidas tracksuits builders hats and highvisibility jackets  were captured entering the building through a side exit before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault  the group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before but one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night  a move mr

            "cnnit was a masterful performance i watched in awe on thursday as cardiothoracic surgeon and celebrity talk show host mehmet oz surfed a gargantuan wave of criticism to shore i should have expected that dr oz would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed quack treatments  for personal financial gain and thanks to the ineptitude of his critics this round he may have actually boosted his media empire  but hes increasingly serving himself at a cost to columbia university and new york presbyterian hospital if dr oz was ever going to go down surely his ship wouldve sunk last summer in the wake of his disastrous testimony before a senate subcommittee he was ostensibly invited to speak as an expert witness about bogus weight loss products  but sen claire mccaskill chairwoman of the senates consumer protection panel  instead made him her chief example of the kind of snake oil salesmen that keep hoodwinking consumers into thinking theres a quick fix for their expanding waistlines john oliver subsequently eviscerated oz on his hit hbo show last week tonight in a segment thats now garnered over 6 million youtube views oliver makes quick work of ozs claims about magic green coffee beans a product thats now earned a 9 million ftc fine for its false marketing claims despite his utter humiliation dr oz soldiered on with his university and hospital continuing to stand by him and with harpo productions and sony who coproduce the dr oz show fully behind his program if the us senate couldnt bring him down what made this particular collection of 10 doctors think they could do it with their recent letter to columbia university where dr oz holds a tenured professorship and administrative position in the department of surgery and performs his duties at columbiaaffiliated new york presbyterian hospital the doctors insisted that the university must disassociate itself from dr oz for his now wellestablished tendency to promote curealls more befitting 1915 than 2015 turnabout is fair play and oz and his producers responded with alacrity slicing and dicing his illprepared challengers with an investigative segment that wouldve made dateline proud he and his team score points with me for pointing out the medias own failings in delightedly circulating the letter without looking into the backgrounds of anyone involved its a simple matter to question ulterior motives when the letter itself takes pains to highlight ozs critical attitude toward gmo foods not one of his greatest indiscretions by a long shot dr oz after all has conducted experiments on his tv audience apparently in violation of the rules of his own academic medical center he has a propensity to spout laughably definitive statements with little to no scientific support such as his advice that every kid in america ought to be on omega3 fatty acids and vitamin d from either the sun or a pill because this regimen will help them withstand concussions instead of mounting a defense of the indefensible claims he delivers so easily and often dr oz routed his critics by quickly pivoting to the undercurrents of their letter he correctly pointed out that several of the letters signatories are gmo industry shills one of the writers campaigned against a california proposition requiring gmo labeling and one of the bunch even served time for felony medicaid fraud these characters never stood a chance in tipping the scales against dr oz but they got their headlines nonetheless dr oz was able to transition their critique of his apparent disregard for science on his program into an easily vanquished attack on his straightforward stand for consumers right to accurate product labeling when my wife first brought the letter to my attention i immediately wanted to know whether these were columbia physicians this whole affair wouldve played out quite differently if a slate of credible colleagues based at his own institution were coming out against dr oz  so far theyve made no demand for his resignation though some colleagues made their discomfort public in an oped for usatoday last week dr oz is wellaware that some colleagues question him discussing that tension in his time magazine oped he says he doesnt expect all physicians to understand his approach to health promotion where hes willing to entertain just about everything even seances the closed physicianonly social network sermo issued dr oz numerous questions from its membership none of which dr oz answered they are revelatory of physician attitudes toward him nonetheless one doc asked dr oz how he could keep up with the fastchanging world of cardiothoracic surgery and carry on with his show every weekday another asked him how he knows so much about so many areas of medicine  ru board certified n all these areas both types of questions show the profound disconnect between most physicians who tend not to speak unless they are certain in their expertise on a topic and the way the media industry works dr ozs show doesnt require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day  he has an office full of production staff behind him lets take it as a given that not every physician across america or at columbia has to agree with what dr oz says on his program i certainly dont does he have the right to say it yes but not without challenge a real case can be made that dr oz has used his media megaphone to do harm as well as good he is now a polarizing figure and while columbia university should be lauded for protecting the free speech of its academic staff the equation with dr oz is becoming increasingly complex hes no longer simply good pr for the university and new york presbyterian hospital which is often featured in his show the letter writers were correct about one thing columbias reputation is now linked with the big kahuna standing right out in front\n",

million people and 6300 square miles of farmland in seven states including california a driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars  the rocky mountain snow that melts into the river doesnt flow directly to california and other downstream users instead its held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings the reservoirs have sufficient water to provide california and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future said matthew allen a spokesman for the federal bureau of reclamation which manages the reservoir system california also gets water from the sierra nevada range where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of recordkeeping as of wednesday warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early march caused the snowpack in colorado to shrink significantly to see the decline that we saw at

statement said mr arwani was a peaceful man who was actively involved in the fight against extremism he spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it it said adding that mr arwani was a british citizen who loved the people of this country murhaf added he loved the idea of democracy and freedom he loved the idea of freedom for all regardless of religion race and background a source has claimed that the killing had all the hallmarks of a statesponsored assassination while a friend laid blame at the feet of assad and his cronies last night the metropolitan police said detectives from its counter terrorism command are carrying out the inquiry because of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad mr arwani was an imam at the annoor mosque in acton west london but was forced to step down last year over reports it was repeatedly linked with extremists he was found with gunshot wounds to his chest in wembley on tuesday morning he was declared dead half an hour later his daughter elham arwani said her father ran a building company and had been visiting wembley in connection with his work speaking from the family home yesterday the 23yearold said we have no idea what happened we dont even know how he was killed we have just been told he was killed and thats it any syrian who is free and who knows the truth is against assad its not going to be because he was against assad it must be for another reason but we cant think of anything she described her father as a loving father and husband and added he was the best person always helping everyone his phone would ring 247 with people asking for help and advice at least 200 mourners gathered to pay tribute to him last night at nadi park royal in willesden junction north west london where he preached every wednesday preacher mr arwani was known for his outspoken opposition to the assad regime  mourners claimed the  imam was a peaceful man who opposed extremism some speculated that he may have been killed in a hit from the syrian regime or because of a disagreement over management of the west london mosque one also said that he had visited syria 10 times in recent years but had been ordered by the turkish government to stop and had been questioned by security services at an airport there dr khaled kamaraldi who gave arwani his first job as a builder 15 years ago said he went out to syria to educate the fighters about the treatment of prisoners of war and about human rights he said if you behaved like the assad regime you become like them he was questioned by security services but they let him go he said everything in his heart he added this was a state kill assad was behind it and if not assad one of his cronies he was very active against the assad regime but he was a conciliator he was not violent what shocks me is they shot him in broad daylight in the centre of london they have no respect there is no doubt the police will get him home mr arwani originally from syria lived in this home in white city west london  one friend solicitor mohammad bassam tablieh 43 from west london said there could be two reasons behind his killing he said number one a dispute about running the mosque number two his activities against assad he was an active member of the opposition against assad there was a problem with dealing with who is imam at the mosque he had nothing to do with extremism at all he was a very moderate person very peaceful he added that many people in london who had green flags in there car as a symbol of being antiassad have had their tyres slashed but did not know if mr arwani had one in his vehicle but haras rafiq managing director of antiextremist thinktank the quilliam foundation said it was too early to start speculating about why mr arwani was killed he said he was definitely antiassad he was very vocal so i had to flee from syria he said the teenager bribed a policeman so he could leave the country he said  but for the next 30 years the authorities questioned his parents once a month in an attempt to find out where he had gone mr arwani blamed the atrocities carried out by the assad regime on its supposed abandonment of islam saying that from the 1960s the government started to implement atheism and take off islam from the life of the people he also claimed that muslim scholars were forced to stop working as imams and told to take jobs selling cosmetics instead the assad regime has been known to assassinate its political opponents in the past most prominently the lebanese prime minister rafik hariri whose killing in 2005 was blamed on the syrian government the annoor mosque where mr arwani used to be one of the main imams has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers the mosque became notorious in 2013 when a terror suspect went there and changed into a burqa in order to escape surveillance then went on the run mohammed ahmed mohamed has been missing for 16 months and was last seen entering annoor dressed as a man before leaving in a fulllength covering designed for women which obscured his identity he was subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measure which restrict the movements of people suspected of involvement in terrorism other extremists linked to the mosque include uthman mustafa kamal the son of hate preacher abu hamza who has regularly led prayers at annoor three years ago another preacher delivered a sermon arguing that jews zionists all of those people who mock the prophet muhammad deserve to face the sword some friends of mr arwani said that he had left the mosque after a dispute about money despite reports that his departure was linked to extremism  ali belai said nothing he said was ever extremist the management forced him out of the mosque there was conflict over money i think it was about 30000 anas qamar another syrian exile said that mr arwani had been involved in a high court battle over the mosques finances when one of the trustees allegedly embezzled money from worshippers abdul hadi said the mosque was a charity and should not be run to profit one man he said he was banished by the mosque the family of a syrian imam who was shot dead on a london street have paid tribute to the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet as counterterror police continue to investigate his murder abdul hadi arwani 48 a fierce critic of president bashar alassad may have been assassinated by the governing regime in his home country according to friends the father of six was found slumped in a volkswagen passat with wounds to his chest on a street in wembley on tuesday morning last night it emerged that metropolitan police counterterrorism officers who handle political assassinations were now leading the inquiry because of its potential international dimensions scroll down for video  outspoken abdul hadi arwani had taken part in a demonstration against president assad three years ago  his son murhaf issued a statement on behalf of the family calling for witnesses to come forward and paying tribute to the political dissident who fled syria after being apparently sentenced to death by assads father my family and i have been in a state of shock ever since we learned of this terrible news he said we have not slept and our minds are a blur as to what happened and why the police are currently investigating this brutal murder as an individual a family and a community we are helping the police to solve this heinous crime murhaf continued he was the most peaceful man you could ever wish to meet he just loved to help people he did not care what your background race or status was he did not care if you were rich or poor he just wanted to help people in need he was an old fashioned man who thought love and understanding could cure all of the worlds ills he was always smiling and joking with everyone

their hands while some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in southern spain they claim they are treated like slaves by agencies who hire them to produce the salads and vegetables that end up on supermarket shelves in britain the investigation by channel 4 news found they also say they are made to work around dangerous pesticides  causing some to fall ill  and are routinely left unpaid for hours they have worked the revelations will horrify millions of customers of british supermarkets all of which tell consumers their food is produced ethically and that

effectively slave labour producing food in 2015 sainsburys and waitrose said they would investigate immediately all the major british supermarkets claim they source food responsibly and they have all

were also sprayed with pesticides but were too afraid to complain because their names would be put on a blacklist known as the list of rotten sardines lettuce the revelations will lead to claims that

probe sainsburys pictured and waitrose said they would investigate the findings immediately  agroherni said it maintains a strict procedure with regard to the use of pesticides and is not aware of any relevant incidents it strongly denied that it mistreats or exploits agency workers and said the fair treatment and safety of workers was paramount however as a result of the channel 4 news investigation it has ceased working with integra empleo and is to employ the workers directly a sainsburys spokesman said we expect our suppliers to adhere to the highest quality and welfare standards regardless of where they operate in the world we are taking these allegations very seriously and will be conducting our own investigation a waitrose spokesman said worker welfare is very important to us  our supplier is investigating these allegations and will ensure that our high standards are being met a spokesman for the british retail consortium which represents all the supermarkets said

on charles and camillas seventh wedding anniversary in 2012 the queen made the duchess a dame grand cross of the royal victorian order gcvo  a personal seal of approval from the monarch i dont think that the queen has ever had any personal animosity to camilla in the eighties and nineties when charles and diana were at each others throats camilla was seen to be the cause and it threatened to destabilise the monarchy says ms junor the queen has always been fond of camilla she knew her for years and years long before she was involved in the break up of the marriage she added the queen

camilla married charles aides insisted she did not want to be known as queen when the prince acceded to the throne but intended to be known as princess consort instead but according to some legal experts unless there is change in the law camilla will technically become queen when charles is king  no matter what she decides to call herself at the time of her engagement to the prince in 2005 a poll showed that only seven per cent of people believed camilla should one day be queen happily married charles has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since his marriage  close the duchess has always known how to make charles laugh and he adores her in return  royal duties with half of britons supporting the idea it is increasingly likely that camilla will become queen  a decade later half of all britons say she should become queen when charles takes the throne according to a poll by yougov a third think she should be given a lesser title out of sensitivity to diana princess of wales and 16

on the 9th april 2005 despite fears that the couple would be booed  camilla was reportedly so nervous that she had to be dragged out of bed  the ceremony went off without a hitch since then the duchess of cornwall as she is now known has become an integral part of the royal family  and would be cheerfully accepted as charles queen by 50 per cent of britons that marks a significant turnaround from the duchess earliest days as a royal with camilla following charles lead and often appearing nervous in front of photographers but her enthusiastic championing of causes ranging from osteoporosis to sexual abuse survivors has not gone unnoticed and her relationship with the queen is now said to be close her role has changed dramatically explains royal biographer penny junor one minute she was

jailed for life after being found guilty of murder  we discovered that hed opened up a private mail box he had redirected all of our mail including bank mail which had prevented me from discovering that gradually the account was being fleeced she said there were enquiries to real estate agents back in the cornwall and devon area suggesting he would be returning shortly to the uk with his infant son at the bottom of his briefcase there was a total of nine life insurance policies which collectively was in excess of a million dollars on my death and they had my signature forged on them chillingly they also discovered a petrol canister in her car and felicity is convinced she narrowly escaped death that day webster went on the run back to the uk while felicity reported him to the new zealand police after investigating they urged scottish police to reopen the case into claires death the lead officer in the case was charles henry he said the original fatal road accident was highly suspicious and it bore all the hallmarks of what was happening in new zealand at that particular point we were facing a highly dangerous individual who was a threat to any women that he was going to be with felicity pictured in 2011 when she gave evidence against webster during the trial in which he was dubbed the black widower however it would take years for the police to build a strong enough case to prove claires death was not an accident and gain enough evidence to charge webster by then he was back living in scotland and was planning to marry another woman who had no idea of his murderous history in may 2011 after a long running trial during which he was dubbed the black widower webster was found guilty of murdering claire attempting to murder felicity and attempting to bigamously marry a third woman to gain access to her estate now aged 55 he is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years i think his sentence aptly reflects the horribleness of his crimes and the fact that he feels no remorse that it was all premeditated and given the opportunity he was about to do it again said felicity who gave evidence against the father of her child at his trial peter who had to wait 21 years to get justice for claire said he and his family can now finally move on even though their lives will never be the same again peter says claires death nearly destroyed their family but now they are rebuilding their lives  he said if anything it taught me that you just have to be a little bit more cautious in life as to who you trust and when you trust them because we could all be living next door to the next malcolm webster peter morris was devastated when his sister claire died in a car crash when she was just 32 only a year before he had walked her

tragic accident that happened in aberdeen scotland in 1994 scroll down for video  peter morris left was devastated when his sister claire pictured right on her hen do died in a car crash  it took two decades for the truth to be revealed  claire had in fact been murdered by webster so he could cash in on her life insurance webster had drugged his wife at their home in the scottish village of tarves where they had settled after their wedding before taking her for a drive he then deliberately crashed their car and after making his own escape set it on fire so claire had no hope of survival last year claires story was turned into an itv drama starring sheridan smith and now peter has gone in front of the cameras to talk about his grief and to reveal the shocking detail of his sisters death which he is still coming to terms with 21 years later the fire brigade said it was the most intense fire they had ever seen from a mile away the flames were leaping 20 30 feet it was just ridiculous peter reveals on the latest episode of britains darkest taboos a very brave fireman tried to retrieve what was left of claire there wasnt much left of her poor love peter said he was shocked and heartbroken when he was told his sister a qualified nurse had lost her life in just terrible circumstances claire and malcolm webster pictured on their wedding day in 1993 the following year he murdered her  he had no reason to suspect webster who claire had met at a party had drugged and then burned her alive claire had been besotted with him and was delighted when they tied the knot in 1993 peter recalls he seemed like the perfect gentleman which is exactly what she would have wanted he was a sort of colin firth type character he said he and webster consoled one another at the funeral and peter believed he was suffering just as much as he was he didnt say a lot at the funeral he appeared to be in a complete state of shock as well he said we were all standing round the graveside in my right hand i was holding on to malcolms left hand i was in floods of tears and they had son together unbeknownst to felicity he started faking her signature to take out life insurance polices in her name and also began poisoning her like he had done to claire felicity also appears on britains darkest taboos and reveals how it felt to be drugged she said these episodes would often begin with a feeling of blurred vision or double vision and unsteadiness on my feet my speech was sometimes become a little bit slurred i would stagger around as if i was drunk and then would fall into a deep sleep she couldnt believe her husband could be the cause of her illness but a pattern was forming these events occurred after he had prepared a meal or a drink for me they were always at the weekends never inconveniently when i had to be able to go to work she said then in circumstances similar to claires death in 1999 she was driven by webster to a remote location when she was feeling tired and drowsy it seems webster could have been about to commit murder again  until he was interrupted by a phone call from felicitys concerned parents felicity recalls how webster was angry

            "d got married years earlier and done it properly he was devastated as the way he saw it this was his final gesture for me and it had been ruined by their thoughtlessness the couple had initially dreamed of getting married abroad once mr haigh discovered his advanced pancreatic cancer was terminal however the landlord of the rams head pub in oldham was distraught to discover that his tumour was too large for him to fly safely the pair then settled upon the manchester venue as it was not too far from their home it took three people two hours to get mr haigh ready for his big day and determined to make the day perfect for his bridetobe he battled through pain to make it to the venue mrs haigh 54 said every guest at the ceremony   held in november last year in manchester    wrote a letter of complaint she has three marriage certificates pictured as the first two were riddled with errors  the couple had an examiner testing the registrar doing their ceremony pictured and were given an invalid marriage certificate as it featured the wrong date an amended version posted later was full spelling errors  however it was upon their arrival at the venue that the catalogue of errors began they said they found the register office dirty and claimed they were forced to wipe dirt from the seats before they sat down then they noticed a woman sat at the back as they said their vows which turned out to be an examiner testing the registrar mrs haigh a mother of three said there was some random woman sat at the back who none of us knew and it was only after i asked i was told she was assessing the registrar to see how she did on the day geoff haigh and his wife heather endured a catalogue of blunders during their wedding day it felt like they were merely using us a practice go like our special day was not the real thing or of any importance to them after the bride and groom said their vows guests were left on their own to the sound of their bridal music wonderful life while the registrar went out of the room unbelievably almost half an hour passed before she returned and the song played 10 times over before mrs haigh was compelled to take action she said everyone was groaning when the song kept coming back on we couldnt believe it it had been a special song for us she said it wasnt about the money but to say there was no loss ignores the emotional cost it took on my husband it was the arrogance and flippant attitude that hurt even more they said we all make mistakes and we are only human thats fine when you make mistakes in a restaurant with someones food but when you are dealing with a terminally ill mans dying wish and the most special day of our lives that attitude is not acceptable the wedding day was so full of blunders that all 11 guests wrote a separate letter of complaint to manchester register office which is based at heron house pictured  in the city centre where the pair said their vows  the family has since received an apology from manchester city council which runs the register office based at heron house a spokesman said id like to offer our sincerest apologies to mrs taylor as the ceremony did not meet her expectations these types of problems are thankfully exceptionally rare and our registry staff are incredibly conscientious they understand that they play a vital role in the most important day of a couples life and would never knowingly do anything to spoil or delay a wedding however tragically mr haigh died on january 4 this year before receiving the apology his wife added geoff was determined not to die over christmas because he said it would ruin it for everyone after he was gone for years to come and he didnt want that for us the energy it took from him to hang on but it is definitely tainted by that day now after the ceremony as they went off to enjoy their wedding reception at city centre restaurant san carlos the couple were informed that they would have to return to the register office as officials had logged the wrong date on their marriage certificate they were instructed to go back to the venue to have the gaffe corrected otherwise their marriage was invalid mrs haigh told officials that her husband was too ill and could barely walk so they would have to post the amended certificate instead however when the second certificate arrived in the post it was addressed to mrs haigh in her maiden name taylor and included spelling errors on the document a third certificate then had to be posted out to the couple mr haigh above passed away in january this year just weeks after his wedding to longterm partner heather the couple decided they wanted to get married when he was diagnosed as terminal late last year  mrs haigh left said her new husband right was left devastated by the series of blunders and said he felt like he had let her down she has received 137 from the manchester register office following the calamity day  mrs haigh said it felt like they didnt recognise we were married and that really hurt geoff before he died it made if feel like the whole thing didnt happen like it meant nothing at all it was devastating the guests were all in tears for us they were all absolutely disgusted and no one could believe the day could have gone so atrociously the newlyweds were offered a 137 refund but mrs haigh said they were told by the register office that there was not a significant enough loss to warrant compensation\n",

            "the draw for the champions league has pitted pep guardiolas bayern munich against his former club barcelona while handing italian champions a daunting task against holders real madrid with subplots aplenty and quality assured the final four of europeans premier competition will all feel they have a real chance of adding to their european titles sportsmails reporters look at each sides reasons for optimism and caution ahead of the semifinals bayern munich by chris wheeler  reasons they can win the champions league  bayern have an excellent champions league pedigree with a coach in pep guardiola who won this competition twice at barcelona and a squad that has retained its best players since beating borussia dortmund in the final at wembley two years ago so do barca and real madrid but unlike their main rivals munich can focus largely on europe thanks to a 12point lead over wolfsburg in the bundesliga and the minor inconvenience of a german cup semifinal against dortmund guardiola can also expect to call on key players like arjen robben franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger who did not appear in either of the quarterfinal legs against fc porto pepe guardiola issues instructions to his players during a supremely impressive performance against porto  guardiola must now work out how to prevent his sides old vulnerabilities returning against barcelona  reasons they cant  usually so dominant there is a peculiar vulnerability about bayern under guardiola it was painfully evident in their 50 aggregate defeat by real madrid in the semifinals a year ago and again in the 31 loss to porto earlier this month before they turned it around in the second leg in stunning fashion munich cannot afford to be off their game against barca noone knows guardiolas gameplan better than his old club he will have to overcome them  and then possibly real  if he wants to win the champions league again bayern were brilliant in munich but a repeat of their porto horrorshow could see them dumped out  real madrid by pete jenson  reasons they can win the champions league  theres a sense that the worst has past they did not want atletico madrid in the quarterfinals having failed to beat them already six times this season then when jan oblak worked his miracles in the first leg and the injuries and suspensions mounted up in the second the task looked even tougher but they came through carlo ancelotti was vindicated for pitching javier hernandez into his forward line and moving sergio ramos into midfield with the coach in a strong position and the squad behind him they can do it real madrid will feel like they have got over their biggest hurdle after their late win over atletico madrid  reasons they cant  no one player is more important to real madrid than luka modric they can cope without bale if ronaldo is playing and they can cope without ronaldo if bale is playing  they won the copa del rey last year that way but bales former tottenham teammate has no real replacement atletico were poor on wednesday night and so the croatian was not missed too much but against juventus his absence will be felt he could be back for the final but they may not get there without him the injury to luka modric is the single biggest obstacle standing in carlo ancelottis way to retaining the title  juventus by neil ashton  reasons they can win the champions league the travel advice to anyone planing to watch juventus in the semifinal is to take a good book massimiliano allegris team are living proof that the art of defending italianstyle is alive and well after keeping nine clean sheets in their last 10 matches that threeman defence comprising leonardo bonucci andrea barzagli and giorgio chiellini loves smothering opposition strikers conceivably both legs of the semifinals could finish 00 as well as the final and the italians will be delighted to fastforward to the penalty shootout up front they rely on the example set by their talisman carlos tevez with his nonstop chasing and harrying of opposition defenders plus his goals the likes of giorgio chiellini left and leonard bonucci have provided a solid defence for juve to build on  reasons they cant  even allegri knows there are many limitations with this juventus team do not get seduced by the cries of ole ole ole ole juve juve because tikitaka this isnt andrea pirlos masterful powers are also on the wane after his brilliant career with milan juve and italy andrea pirlo still runs the show for the old lady but the italians best days are now behind him  barcelona by pete jensen  reasons they can win the champions league  it may be true that bayern munich have scored 115 goals this season but leo messi luis suarez and neymar have scored 95 between them barcelonas front three have clicked in a way that luis enrique would not have dared dream neither is the barcelona forward line ornamental when the team are defending messi drops deep to try to get the team passing  once he has stopped being messi he will become the new xavi  and suarez defends from the front chasing down the opposition and forcing errors there is a sense that they are carrying the team to berlin barcelonas front three of luis suarez left neymar centre and lionel messi can carry the whole team  reasons they cant  for now there are neither injuries nor suspensions but they are forever on the cusp of a potential crisis because the strength in depth is just not there ivan rakitic sergi busquets and andres iniesta is a fine midfield but the secondstring middle three of rafinha sergio roberto and the now 35yearold xavi offers fewer guarantees likewise at the back there is a gulf in class between the four firstchoice defenders and those who would have to step in injuries to key players like ivan rakitic could expose the lack of depth in barcelonas squad\n",

            "england could have a separate income tax rate to scotland under radical new reforms which will be introduced within 100 days of a tory election victory david cameron announced today the prime minister pledged to deliver effective home rule for england  giving mps the same powers to set tax rates which have been agreed for scotland following last years independent referendum mr cameron said in the interests of fairness english mps must be given a veto on legislation that no longer applies in scotland scroll down for video  high on the list david cameron and william hague will today pledge that delivering effective home rule for england will be one of their partys top priorities if reelected  under mr camerons plan english welsh and northern irish mps being able to set a separate rate of income tax to that in scotland with mps north of the border having no say  mr cameron said a conservative government would have the new system in place in time for the first budget of the new parliament in march 2016 it will mean english welsh and northern irish mps being able to set a separate rate of income tax to that in scotland  where the snp is expected to hold sway after the election  with mps north of the border having no say if wales votes in favour of the welsh assembly having income tax powers like those being devolved to holyrood in a proposed referendum welsh mps would also be excluded the plan will involve reforming parliaments committee stage where mps discuss legislation in detail no bill or part of a bill relating only to england would be able to pass to its third reading and become law without being approved in a grand committee made up of all english mps the plan is likely to trigger a row with labour which opposes the idea of an english veto mr cameron helps build an industrial fan during a campaign visit in colchester in essex this afternoon  the prime ministers visit came as he courted english voters with an election pledge to create a separate rate of income tax for england  the party has traditionally relied on the votes of its army of scottish mps at westminster which it used to implement tuition fees and foundation hospitals even though they did not apply in scotland labours leader in scotland jim murphy yesterday claimed mr cameron was cheap nasty and an election agent for the snp in scotland he has given up on the scottish tory party and is throwing his lot in with the snp david cameron is the agent and the campaign manager for the snp mr murphy said but mr cameron speaking lincoln said we do not support english nationalists we do not want an english parliament we are the conservative and unionist party through and through this manifesto simply recognises that the democratic picture has got more complicated in the uk so beyond our main manifesto english voters deserve one document clarifying in black and white what they can expect soon the scottish parliament will be voting to set its own levels of income tax  and but that has clear implications english mps will be unable to vote on the income tax paid by people in aberdeen and edinburgh while scottish mps are able to vote on the tax you pay in birmingham or canterbury or leeds it is simply unfair and with english votes for english laws we will put it right former foreign secretary william hague added this is not a vague promise to make this change some time in the future this is a plan ready to be implemented we will table our proposals within the first hundred days after the general election and after consultation with the procedure committee of the house of commons and running a pilot test of the new rules we will fully implement our plan within the first year of the new parliament and apply it to the budget of 2016 other commitments in the tories english manifesto include a commitment to spend more on the nhs in real terms every year deliver a truly sevenday nhs and keep the cancer drugs fund which pays for expensive treatments on the english nhs it also promises to give more schools in england freedoms so they are in charge of their own affairs continue to allow charities teachers and universities to set up new schools in the state sector and keep school league tables commuter rail fares in england will be frozen for five years and working parents of three and fouryearolds will get 30 hours a week free childcare the right to buy will be extended to all housing association tenants in england and 200000 new starter homes will be offered at 20 per cent below the market price for firsttime buyers under 40 mr cameron added my message to people who want these things who want their own home more childcare an nhs protected and their taxes cut is there is only one way to guarantee it vote conservative on may 7 a vote for anyone else makes an ed milibandsnp government more likely  which will put all these things at risk only a strong conservative government will deliver for you and your

            "from the sky it appears to be an idyllic island with amazing beaches and a dense forest but tourists or fishermen dont dare to set foot on this outcrop in the indian ocean due to its inhabitants fearsome reputation visitors who venture onto or too close to north sentinel island risk being attacked by members of a mysterious tribe who have rejected modern civilisation and prefer to have zero contact with the outside world when they do interact with outsiders it usually involves violence  the indigenous sentinelese tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in 2006 and have been known to fire arrows and fling rocks at lowflying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions scroll down for video  sentinelese tribespeople holding javelins gather on the shore of north sentinel island located in the bay of bengal  following the 2004 tsunami this member of the sentinelese tribe was photographed firing an arrow at an indian coast guard helicopter  this satellite image taken by nasa shows the untouched north sentinel island which is about the size of manhattan  located in the bay of bengal north sentinel island belongs to india and remains an enigma despite being populated for an estimated 60000 years untouched by modern civilisation very little is known about the sentinelese people their language their rituals and the island they call home it is too dangerous to approach them due to their hostility to outsiders meaning they are rarely photographed up close and almost never seen on video most of the photos and video clips that do exist are of poor quality there are also conflicting reports on the tribes population with most estimates putting it in the range of a few dozen to a few hundred its still unclear what impact the 2004 tsunami had on the population and the island which is part of indias chain of andaman islands although the uncontacted tribe managed to avoid being wiped out after the tsunami one member was photographed attempting to fire an arrow at an indian coast guard helicopter the tribespeople are rarely photographed or recorded on video the only existing images or video clips tend to be of poor quality  to protect the sentinelese people  and visitors  the indian government has established a threemile exclusion zone  often referred to as a stone age tribe  a title that advocates take offence to as its members have adapted over time  the sentinelese may be the most isolated tribe in the world with the indian government choosing not to meddle in their affairs the government made several failed attempts to establish contact but has abandoned all attempts and allows the tribe to live how it chooses on an island that is about the size of manhattan indian authorities have gone as far as making it a crime to try to make contact with the sentinelese it is illegal to go within three miles of the island while privileged people are eating 15 burgers and splashing 100 on new trainers the nearnaked sentinelese are surviving off the land and hunting for sea creatures but the waters surrounding the island appear to be under threat by even more illegal fishermen survival international said the islanders are extremely healthy alert and thriving but their fishing waters are being threatened  this aerial image shows the dense tree canopy on the island which has remained untouched by modern civilisation for centuries  survival international reported late last year that it had received reports that fishermen are targeting the area with seven men being apprehended by the indian coast guard one of the fishermen reportedly stepped foot on the island in close proximity to the tribes members and he managed to leave unscathed survival international which advocates for tribal peoples rights describes the sentinelese as the most vulnerable society on the planet as they are likely to have no immunity to common diseases such as flu and measles due to their complete isolation the chances of them being wiped out by an epidemic are very high according to the organisation this aerial image from google maps shows a shipwreck off the coast clashes with salvagers have left several tribespeople dead  in a statement survival internationals director stephen corry said the great andamanese tribes of indias andaman islands were decimated by disease when the british colonised the islands in the 1800s the most recent to be pushed into extinction was the bo tribe whose last member died only four years ago the only way the andamanese authorities can prevent the annihilation of another tribe is to ensure north sentinel island is protected from outsiders the organisation said the islanders are extremely healthy alert and thriving despite threats from the outside world and their old world way of life their hostility towards outsiders can at least be partially attributed to past conflicts survival international said the outside world has brought them little but violence and contempt in the late 1980s and early 1990s several tribespeople were killed in battles with armed salvagers who visited the island to recover iron and other goods from a shipwreck\n",

            "the countrys biggest food bank organisation yesterday claimed the number of people claiming free meal packages from its branches passed a million last year the figures from the trussell trust were seized on by labour and the tuc as shocking evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay the socalled bedroom tax and stopped benefits but tory benefits chief iain duncan smith questioned the numbers which he said were unverified and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work the trussel trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in glasgow  another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a political football the row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks  said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming and by critics to show that when free food is handed out people will always come forward to take it yesterdays report from the trust put the number of people who were given three days worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1084604 its uk director adrian curtis said despite welcome signs of economic recovery hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men women and children the latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the uk the latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks with a rise of under 100000 in numbers recorded since 201314 when there were 913138 food bank visits iain duncan smith pictured dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the trussell trusts figures are unverified this figure was almost three times the 201213 level of 346992 in 200910 the trust recorded 40898 food bank visits the claims have been disputed because the trussell trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given threeday food packages and not numbers of individuals this means an unknown number make repeat visits and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million research carried out by the trust oxfam the church of england and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks it found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract a chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise david cameron over the figures labours work and pensions spokesman rachel reeves said the shocking rise in the number of people relying on trussell trust food banks since 2010 shows the tory plan is failing david camerons failure to tackle low pay the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid tuc general secretary frances ogrady said this should make all of us ashamed particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery it tells us that the government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net vicious sanctions and benefit cuts  even for those who paid in all their working lives  are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident oxfam poverty chief rachael orr said it is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the uk the picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected usbased social progress index published earlier this month which put britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger mr duncan smith said the trusts figures were unverified he added we are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory  whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone the best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work  and weve got a strong record there two million more people in work since the last election frances ogrady trade union congress general secretary pictured described the figure as shameful it is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it the oxford food bank which is independent of the trussell trust network urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures the organisation which distributes food to other charities which provide meals rather than handing it out to individuals said we think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon  whereas food poverty is not as an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of oxford we adopt a nonpolitical stance to do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support the issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading we congratulate the trussell trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle it is high time the ofb model of food bank  which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty  is encouraged and replicated elsewhere\n",

vulnerability spoke volumes goalkeeper david de gea actually looked to be in trouble as jesus navas attempted to run on to a short backpass in the 14th minute and the ensuing clearance was more of a hack than a measured pass to the left wing but when fellaini won a challenge with pablo zabaleta opportunity suddenly beckoned the ball broke to ander herrera and when he crossed to the near post young edged his dual with clichy to nudge the ball over the line after it broke off both of them wayne rooney leaps onto fellainis back after united take the lead through the big belgian who has had an excellent renaissance recently  ander herrera skips inside fellow countryman david silva during another decent showing from the spaniard who pulled the strings  mata gives gael clichy something to think about as the mercurial spaniard plots another attack for the hosts  coming at a time when united had looked weak the psychological effects of the equaliser were immediate and far reaching the momentum of the game shifted towards red and city never managed to reverse it united were not particularly fluent and it was for a while a tight game played in an atmosphere that reflected the stakes however the home team looked to have more energy more purpose and more conviction this is what confidence does to a team and by the 21st minute they were in the lead this time city had to ask themselves questions and over the remainder of the game it became a theme the threat in the air from fellaini was obvious but somehow he managed to isolate clichy at the far post as young crossed above the head of the taller martin demichelis who was essentially marking nobody it was as the bare facts suggest a mismatch and fellaini powered above his opponent to head the ball through joe hart and in to the corner less than a quarter of the game had gone but already the road back for city looked long from that point on until agueros late consolation city hardly made a chance aguero finished off an incisive city move which cut through uniteds defence in an impressive opening spell  united went back to basics for the leveller with young pouncing after herreras cross hit gael clichy  united exploited citys right wing for their second too with young and daley blind combining to great effect  intelligent play from rooney set up the third with mata darting through and coolly slotting home  smalling rose unmarked to head youngs freekick beyond hart to make it 41 for rampant united  aguero gave a semblance of respectability to the scoreline by meeting pablo zabaletas cross late on  as halftime neared their captain vincent kompany could have been sent off for a lunge at blind as it was he strained a muscle making the challenge and didnt reappear for a second period that began with hart saving wayne rooneys freekick\n",

holidays on the horizon and hence no impending bikini body exposure to panic about we needed something else to give us some motivation to get in the gym that motivation came in the form of stripping down to my bra and pants and taking my first body selfie i was by no means overweight however by looking at my body objectively i wasnt happy with what i saw and i decided i needed to make a change i started a new fitness programme and started eating reasonably healthily joe also charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and charlotte decided to launch healthy selfie charlotte continued to take photos each week and would compare them to see how far she had come she said at the end of a sixweek period i compared the images with the help of joes photoshop expertise the results were incredible  my body had completely changed  all in complete contradiction to the number on the scales  which had risen as i gained more muscle charlotte and joe right launched  the app after taking selfies  following an an indulgent christmas  joe charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and charlotte decided to launch the app  charlotte said this was where the idea for healthy selfie was born we wanted to create an app that made tracking and comparing your selfies a quick and easy process by then publishing those photos in a social networking environment the images become so much more than a selftracking tool  they become a source of information from which other users can glean ideas and inspiration your images become testaments to the efficacy of whatever programme diet detox or cleanse youre pursuing charlotte says the app also provides a safe and supportive community for you to upload your pictures too with users using the comments section

fitness for sport however i received harsh banter from my peers at school and i recall one friend saying i will never get a six pack i allowed this to fuel my determination to this day harry says using the app he charted his progress its given me a great confidence boost but i was so wrong it took time for the weight to come off and these habits continued on until i was 16 the user posted pictures of herself in the gym as she trained  to regain a healthy body with tone and muscle  i was diagnosed with anorexia that really shocked me because i didnt feel like anything was wrong with me the user posted pictures of herself in the gym as she trained hard to regain a healthy body with tone and muscle  she revealed i thought about what i wanted to be like before my eating disorder took a hold of me i wanted to be strong and muscular toned and fit she started charting her transformation on instagram but moved over the healthy selfie when it launched in january she said i think selfies are a great idea especially for people with eating disorders it allows you to see how much healthier you are not just in your body but your face is filled out again your eyes actually have a sparkle in them your smile is real and yes i definitely feel encouraged to continue posting progress pics if you ever start doubting your progress looking at old photos make you realise just how much your physique has improved no one expects to become arnold schwarzenegger overnight but the small incremental changes that you dont notice from just looking in the mirror every day is what kept me

            "the mysterious moai statues of easter island have gazed inland for hundreds of years and now experts believe they have finally discovered how the rapa nui people placed distinctive hats made of red stone on top of some of the figures heads more than 700 years ago they believe that the hats or pukao were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures which measure up to 40ft 12 metres tall mystery solved experts believe they have finally discovered how the rapa nui people placed distinctive hats made of red stone on top of some of the easter island figures heads more than 700 years ago  despite the size of the statues sean hixon an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the university of oregon believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy it seems like a relatively small number of people could have done it either by levering or rolling he told the 80th annual meeting of the society for american archaeology this is despite the largest pukaos measuring sixandahalf feet two metres in diameter and weighing 12 tonnes 1890 stone some 1000 carved moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile 25km volcanic island which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on earth with just 6000 residents a tall order physicists believe that the pukao or hats were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures examples are pictured left and right some of which measure up to 40 ft 12 metres tall  remote some 1000 carved moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile 25km volcanic island which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on earth with just 6000 residents  the moai are monolithic human figures carved by the rapa nui people on easter island between 1250 and 1500 ad all the figures have overlylarge heads and are thought to be living faces of deified ancestors the 887 statues gaze inland across the island with an average height of 13ft four metres all but 53 of the moai were carved from tuff  compressed volcanic ash  and around 100 wear red pukao of scoria in 1979 archaeologists said the statues were designed to hold coral eyes the figures are believed to be symbol of authority and power they may have embodied former chiefs and were repositories of spirits or mana they are positioned so that ancient ancestors watch over the villages while seven look out to sea to help travellers find land but it is a mystery as to how the vast carved stones were transported into position the island is half the size of the isle of wight or twice the size of manhattan and lies 2236 miles 3600km west of the south american mainland since europeans came to easter island or rapa nui in the 1700s people have wondered how the vast carved stones were erected complete with their hats some experts believe the stones were walked into place while others have suggested that locals chopped down trees to roll the statues into position unwittingly destroying the forests and causing their own demise through lack of natural resources an estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far either in place on the statues or scattered nearby they are made from red volcanic rock called scoria and experts are divided as to what they may have been with suggestions ranging from hairstyles to turbans and diadems despite this many agree that the red colour of the stone indicates that the pukao had ritual significance mr hixons team used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a moais head using different techniques these included rolling a hat up a ramp building a tower using a pulley system and putting the hat on the statue before raising the whole statue as one they concluded that the rounded oblong shape of the pukao means that it would have required relatively little energy to roll them up a ramp standing guard an estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far either in place on the statues or scattered nearby this map shows the location of the 887 statues which gaze inland across the island with an average height of 13ft four metres it may have been possible for less than 10 men to roll a hat into place because the oblong shape stopped it easily rolling down the ramp again but was still a good shape for being hauled upwards some of the statues have indentations which may have stopped them tipping over during placement of the pukao and a number of the hats also have vertical marks and ringshaped indentations on their side which may indicate that strips of wood were used to provide traction up the ramp however while the team thinks ramps were the most likely method for the placing of the hats their models revealed that any of the proposed methods for raising the pukao would have been possible  with enough manpower erosion and damage have also scarred the sides of the pukao meaning that analysis of marks and scratches is far from conclusive it is not known exactly how the vast easter island statues came to line the perimeter of the small island but in 2013 scientists claimed they may have been walked into position a team led by archaeologists carl lipo from the university of california state university long beach and terry hunt of the university of hawaii claimed the statues bases were carved so they could lean forward to make them easier to transport walk the walk a team of experts created a fivetonne replica of one of the statues and moved it into an upright position on a dirt path in hawaii to prove that the statues could have been walked into place  the researchers illustrated the theory by creating a fivetonne replica of one of the statues and moving it into an upright position on a dirt path in hawaii with just a few ropes a team of 18 people could rock the statue back and forth each time inching the statue on just a little bit more the mode of transport would have taken about two weeks the bases would then have been flattened to stand the statues upright once they reached position mr lipo said the findings may help dismantle the traditional story line of easter island or rapa nui that a crazed maniacal group destroyed their environment by cutting down trees to transport gigantic statues previous studies have suggested that a lost civilization chopped down trees on the island laid the statues prone and rolled them into place using logs\n",

            "this is the drill that was used by thieves during the 60million hatton garden heist over the easter weekend the gang used the power tool to cut through the  wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems the photograph of the hilti dd350 drill was released tonight by scotland yard  as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an oceans 11 type team police are offering a 20000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid the six men were captured on cctv as they carried out the bold raid in londons diamond district they used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the banks strongroom where they ransacked security vaults but amazingly the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high  meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement images of the scene show the mayhem that detectives discovered when they arrived at the crime scene in londons diamond district safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools  including the heavy duty hilti dd350 used to access the vaults  were discarded nearby scotland yard also described how there was rubbish covering the hatton garden basement while the wroughtiron cage door had been broken down an angle grinder concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building indicating that they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside one of the theories behind the  heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises the hatton garden safe deposit company is housed in a sevenstorey building which accommodates 60 other businesses including watch traders and diamond wholesalers the thieves appeared to have disabled the communal lift on the second floor before using the lift shaft  which was destroyed when police officers arrived at the scene  to climb down to the vault breaking in the gang used the power tool to cut through the concrete wall of the secured vault pictured  caught on cctv scotland yard previously released several images of the gang as they entered the premises  reward police are offering a 20k reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal  unaware the men had their faces covered but sources have suggested they were not aware of the camera  they then opened shutter doors into the basement before boring holes into the basement wall appearing on the bbcs crimewatch tonight detective superintendent craig turner head of the flying squad said that the theft had been carried out by an almost oceans 11 type team mr turner said this was a particularly ambitious burglary to say the least and has affected so many victims peoples property has been taken peoples pensions peoples heirlooms which obviously cant be replaced by insurance firms we may well be misled  this is carried out by an almost oceans 11 type team but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves destruction dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in london where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor  covered in dust and debris left the forced door to the vault and right the mess left in the corridor  inside knowledge the gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door pictured  carefully planned officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft pictured to climb down  peter kirkham a former dci with the met police who worked for the flying squad for five years in the mid90s said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the  heist was an inside job another former flying squad detective said everything you see indicates a very specialist knowledge both in what was inside the building and how to deal with it thursday april 2 workers from businesses in the building go home for long easter weekend some have claimed the thieves were already hiding inside the building waiting to be locked in friday april 3 police have found no signs of forced entry at the premises but an intruder alarm sounded at the safety deposit business in the basement at 0021 no police car was sent traders have claimed a security guard attended the site but said he wasnt paid enough to look inside the vaults saturday april 4 sunday april 5 and monday april 6 the exact time of the raid has not been confirmed but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes it is thought to have taken many hours tuesday april 7 at 8am workers return to the building and finding scenes of chaos they call the police who attend there is an expertise combined with strength patience determination and probably an inside knowledge releasing the scene images yesterday scotland yard said forensics had finished examining the scene and that it had taken a significant amount of time the force said the team had recorded packaged and recovered approximately 400 exhibits including items for dna profiling fingerprints and other evidence specialist forensic photographers have also mapped out the crime scene and utilised digital techniques to record the inside of the premises it said speaking tonight mr turner appealed for members of the public who may have been in the hatton garden area during the theft and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward describing the drill that had been found at the scene as a specialised bit of equipment he called for members of the criminal community who may have seen the gang in possession of it to get in touch there are still six victims who have not been identified yet by police mr turner said i appeal to any of those victims who havent been contacted by police to contact the incident room he added the police previously released cctv footage showing the suspects believed to be involved in the heist  the picture showed three suspects using a side door to the building as well as a van used by the gang heavyduty the

            "faris alkhori 62 was found with a hoard of explosive ingredients and recipes for bombs in his flats  a former syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bombmaking instructions at his home faris alkhori had dozens of chemicals poisonous materials bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb a court heard the equipment was found purely by chance in april last year after a fire at a block of flats in the muirhouse area of edinburgh firefighters who were responding to a 999 call over a fire within a rubbish chute on the 11th floor had forced entry to a flat registered to alkhori and found jars containing various powders castor beans which can be used to make ricin were also found the building was evacuated while the police and army explosive ordnance device eod experts were called in to test the substances  some of which were years old alkhori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the forensic explosives laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed a search was carried out at a further block where the 62yearold lived with his wife in leith and a further haul of material was recovered both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off alkhori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in february he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 explosive substances act police seized bombmaking instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit pictured from the properties  two colemans mustard jars were found being used to store a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate  sentencing him to three years and four months in prison judge lady wolffe said you assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area the number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence the court heard that much of the bombmaking equipment which also included electrical circuits had been ordered from online retailers defence qc brian mcconnachie said what seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies mainly through amazon the material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to mr alkhori it has always been done in the open and over a period of time many of the items have never been opened alkhori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 explosive substances act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients  it is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials it seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything detective superintendent david gordon who led the investigation said this was a significant and complex inquiry for police scotland to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish alkhoris motives for storing them a thorough investigation by the organised crime and counter terrorism unit and crown office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe faris alkhori was acting independently however he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the fire service and armed forces we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion the items from the flats in edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered  i am also grateful to the city of edinburgh council for their work to rehouse vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public alkhoris activities went unnoticed for many years demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep scotland safe counter terrorism is one of police scotlands highest priorities and whilst alkhori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified alkhori who was born in damascus and raised in a christian family trained as a doctor in iraq but has never practised medicine in britain after arriving here in 1984 he was the fulltime carer for his wife who suffers from schizophrenia and has had british citizenship since 1998 police and army explosive ordnance device eod experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials  lindsey miller the crown offices procurator fiscal for organised crime and counterterrorism added the conviction of alkhori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public alkhori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives we worked closely with police service of scotland and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that alkhori was brought to justice i want to reassure the people of scotland that we take any such offences extremely seriously and our specialist prosecutors will continue to treat them as an absolute priority\n",

protests that are sweeping the country he also told how he desperately tried to save mr sithole by taking him to a nearby medical centre but in a desperate twist he found it was closed because the foreignborn doctor had failed to turn up for his shift for fear of being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township scroll down for video  photographer james oatway left who captured the brutal murder of migrant emmanuel sithole right in south africa has spoken out after coming under fire for taking pictures instead of trying to save the victim  sick as emmanuel sithole lay injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench  under siege the brutal attack was captured on camera on saturday morning by a journalist from south africas sunday times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreignborn shopkeepers whod had their businesses looted overnight  beaten as children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening the mozambiqueborn passerby was attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench  he told radio 702s john robbie the one regret that i have was that the first clinic that we took him to werent equipped to treat him we did lose some valuable time taking him out of the car there taking him into the clinic and then the nurses told us that theres no doctor there they put a gauze dressing on his wound and then we put him back in the car but that whole process took about 10 minutes mr sithole who had been found bleeding to death in a gutter was taken to hospital where he later died the cause of death established as a direct stab wound to the heart mr oatway also defended his decision to take the images saying they reflected the absolute stark reality of the situation harrowing a third attacker  then entered the fray running over and kicking mr sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butchers knife  brave before the man had the chance to use the large knife a witness intervened and the three attackers fled the scene  he said its not easy to look at and i understand that some people might be offended by that but really people have to know whats happening and people have to see the brutality and the vulgarity of whats going on i think that people who are angry with me for taking the pictures should try and direct their anger at the men that are responsible for the attack and not at me four south african men accused of stabbing mr sithole appeared in court yesterday accused of murder they will remain in custody until a trial set to be held on may 4 mr oatway captured the attack while he was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreignborn shopkeepers whod had their businesses looted overnight but as children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening the mozambiqueborn passerby was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench as mr sithole sat injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench dying witnesses took mr sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreignborn duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township  fatally wounded in a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because the a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself  during the subsequent journey to hospital mr sitholes condition deteriorated as he screamed in agony before eventually falling unconscious  a third attacker  wearing a grey hoodie  then reportedly entered the fray running over and kicking mr sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butchers knife before he had the chance to use the knife a witness intervened and the three men fled the scene it was too late for mr sithole however who managed to stumble along the road pleading for help for his fatal injuries before collapsing fatally injured in a rubbishstrewn gutter oatways  images were published on the front page of south africas sunday times under the headline kill thy neighbor alex attack brings home sas shame following the attack fearful immigrants in south africa revealed they had been targeted  by longtime neighbors and people who warned they would assault anyone carrying a foreign passport the immigrants spoke at a tent camp where they are now living having fled alexandra when the mobs began attacking shops owned by those from other african countries the violence in alexandra township followed antiimmigrant riots in and around the coastal city of durban that killed at least six people recalling a bout of similar unrest in south africa in 2008 in which about 60 people died four south african men suspected of killing mozambican national emmanuel sithole in alexandra township in an apparent xenophobic attack are arraigned at the wynberg magistrate court in johannesburg\n",

            "and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him meekings on the face there is absolutely no excusing such crass incompetence mclean and muir should both have seen the handball with their own eyes and even if one may have blinked at the wrong moment assuredly one of them should have ensured the right call was made that they didnt is another blight on whats been a desperate season for officiating in this country perhaps more than ever the sfa now has good reason to press fifa to at least roadtest video technology its hardly unchartered territory in sport for those who prefer the oval ball game a television match official has been part of the fabric of rugby for 14 years now noone claims the system is perfect  decisions can often take longer to reach than they should  but few would dispute that it hasnt enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at lampards disallowed goal forced fifa to rethink and scottish fans must hope for a similar incident  used only in firstclass and international televised games the tmo can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him this usually involves in tryscoring situations whether a players foot has been in touch or to see if the ball has been properly grounded but the tmo is also used to review if there has been dangerous or foul play while the video review is normally conclusive the snag  which is clearly a red flag for fifa  is the time delay at a recent aviva premiership match between northampton saints and saracens it took four minutes of review to award the winning try to the former while two other tries were disallowed edward griffiths the saracens chief executive later labelled the tmo process a shambles its almost make it up as you go along griffiths said indeed rugbys growing concern over the effect the tmo is having on the sport has led to hawkeye the balltracking technology company to hold talks with the international rugby board about providing a replacement to the current system rugbys tmo may not be perfect but it has shown that the game is better for use of technology  hawkeye which is already used in cricket tennis and for goalline decisions in football says it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles paul hawkins the founder of hawkeye said our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents in aussie rules we have halved the average time for decisions to be made it can be assumed that were fifa to give tacit approval to video technology hawkeye would have just the programme to fit the bill using it sparingly would maintain the rhythm of football whilst ensuring that the 17 laws of the game are correctly applied for football the answers are already out there if only someone would first ask the questions you wont find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen bylaws of the game until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on fifas front step the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut rows over goalline technology were hardly something new when frank lampards infamous ghost goal against germany in the 2010 world cup finally brought matters to a head the 2000 africa cup of nations final between nigeria and cameroon had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a pedro mendez effort which crossed the line at old trafford was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper roy carroll ending up tangled in the rigging celtic striker leigh griffiths has a goalbound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of josh meekings  such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the portuguese star that fifa did in fact begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goalline systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses it took lampards ruledout effort in bloemfontein  with the ball being clearly a yard over manuel neuers line in the last16 match  for the dam to finally burst despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goalline technology to be approved fifa relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in brazil the lesson for scottish football fans still bemused by events at hampden park on sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially gamechanging handball perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the world cup in russia in three years time will common sense prevail for those who believe the sfa are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen josh meekings red carded and celtic awarded a penalty in the scottish cup semifinal heres some news  in february but it needs to be done in a manner that doesnt detract from the fastpaced quick action of football despite cases also being forwarded by the sfa and irish fa to at least take the matter further fifa aided by a sceptical welsh representative simply kicked the matter into the long grass it wont be discussed again for at least another year now with the inevitable injustices far enough off the radar in the interim its a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played said fifas secretary general jerome valcke by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards while that may well be the case procrastinating on the issue is hardly likely to resolve it injustices like those that almost certainly cost celtic a place in the scottish cup final on sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game celtic captain scott brown left has words with referee steven mclean during the scottish cup semifinal  yet until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a world cup match involving one of the games heavyweights they seem set to remain an ugly unsatisfying feature of the landscape to the great embarrassment of michel platini the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman additional assistant referees  to give them their sunday names  have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 200910 europa league on sunday alan muir the official behind the goal should have had a clear view of meekings handball but for reasons best known to himself he failed to advise referee steven mclean on what seemed an inevitable course of action it took the highprofile blunder that denied frank lampard in 2010 to shift fifa on goalline tecnhology  i knew it was a penalty said celtic striker leigh griffiths\n",

he works out  as the master of his own destiny the man who calls himself money dictated when this megamegafight between the two best boxers on the planet would happen five years too late cry the critics its all in the timing smiles floyd five years ago they would have split 60m at most five years ago only the boxing fraternity would have been paying attention five years ago we would have pitched up at his gym when we liked now mayweather will bank upwards of 180m pacquiao 120m now the whole wide world is waiting their collision with bated breath on this frantic tuesday heavy security guarded the mayweather boxing club for his media day cameras from more than 30 television stations scores of journalists and his usual crew of friends and admirers await and eventually witness a

team as his hands are wrapped before the workout on tuesday  mayweather switches to the bag as he shows off the skills he believes will be enough to beat pacquiao  floyd mayweather suspects manny pacquiao has a neurosis about being the smaller man which leads him to wear lifts in the heel of his shoes when they stand face to face asked if he thought pacquiao had been bothered by anything at their fightlaunch staredown mayweather said hes been surprised to see me so much bigger and taller and i know he wears little lifts in his shoes the tale of the tape measures mayweather standing 5ft

even costlier white rolls bentley coupe the rest of the supercharged fleet stayed home in the mansions garage floyd was followed to work by an lapd police car only this time they were not chasing the man who has had his runins with the law they were guarding one of the most important assets of the city of las vegas which stands to profit by billions in big fight week all in the timing this thing just grows and grows says mayweather we now have one of the biggest fights ever in boxing history and its not only about the money one fight wont define my legacy what about the 47 ive already won its an important fight it wraps everything together  the money and my boxing but if one fight defined everything this would be the only one id have needed and after this he says there will be only one more because it no longer amuses him like it did im pretty much done with all this he tells a few of us summoned into a pocket in the middle of a crowd of people and cameras huge enough to do justice to a royal wedding its not fun like it was back then he explains its business now i dont really enjoy it any longer he promises to fulfil the sixth and last fight of his megamillions showtime

of pacquiao with his eyes and mouth taped  mayweather works out with his trainers as the media swarm around the ring to get a glimpse of the superstar  mayweather took time to speak to the media at one of the few such events before fight week in las vegas  mayweather speaks to the media with the giant figure of pacquiao looming in the background  why always the mgm grand garden he grins shakes a right wrist wrapped in a glittering diamond and gold bracelet it reminds him of the first time tickets for a fight of his there sold out inside six minutes and he happened to mention he had noticed a bejewelled watch in a shop window at one of the mgm hotels they just went and got it as a gift for me he says ran to about 400000 hes come a long way from the drugstrewn gangland streets of grand rapids michigan where he grew up in poverty but much as those baubles are stamped with the hallmarks of his journey to wealth and fame mayweather knows it was a human quality which made it possible loyalty he says loyalty is the heartbeat of boxing whenever i need something the mgm get it for me when i fight one of the biggest fights of all time i take it to the mgm grand garden the clamour around him never stops but there have been heavily hyped events like this before which have turned into anticlimax for the public will this one be worth the money at 10000 for a ringside seat rising to more than 200000 on the black market at virtually 100 per payperview buy here in america its all in the timing our names are way bigger than five years ago you have the two best in the world fighting each other at the pinnacle of their careers and our styles should work itll be exciting mayweather warms up by doing sit ups before he works out in front of the media  having arrived late for his own workout mayweather worked up a sweat with his trainers  mayweather laughs with david hasselhoff who was among the celebrities to attend the workout  american rapper lil kim also stopped by the gym to watch mayweather perform his workout  hayley roberts and hasselhoff arrive at the gym in las vegas to see mayweather put through his paces  not that mayweather is exactly jumping around in frenzied expectation im not excited this is another fight for me id be beaten up worn out ive controlled my fights mayweather works the heavy bag with just over two weeks to go before he steps into the ring with pacquiao  mayweather throws a right hook as he continues to show off his skills on the pads with his uncle  mayweather throws an uppercut as dozens of cameras are trained on the superstar from the ring apron  mayweather takes a break from his workout in the heat of his las vegas gym  mayweather wipes away the sweat as he is put through his paces on a warm day in sin city  pacquiao has also fought more often so by that assessment it is fortunate for him mayweather and their bankers that he is two years the younger mayweather pauses and adds if i hadnt made that decision to be my own boss i wouldnt be where i will be in the grand garden on may 2 wherever he goes in his adopted home town be it a booming casino a heaving night club or his favourite fast food joint fatburger on the vegas strip mr money brews up a storm one created by the nature of the desert blows into the marquee in which we are talking chairs and tables fly as most of the group run for cover mayweather plays pretend scared then strolls into his gym it seems nothing frightens this man who arrived for work this day in a convoy of ludicrously expensive vehicles not a nevada sand storm not

considered large enough to produce such levels so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years now by tracking seismic waves a team of geophysicists has discovered an enormous secondary chamber deeper underground thats so large its partlymolten rock could fill the grand canyon 11 times over scroll down for video  a supervolcano in yellowstone national park pictured releases around 45000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day a magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground  the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world silicic is used to describe magma or igneous rock rich in silica it is situated in yellowstone national park  which spans the midwestern us states of wyoming idaho and montana  and last erupted 640000 years ago the yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world it is situated in yellowstone national park  which spans the midwestern us states of wyoming idaho and montana  and last erupted 640000 years ago although lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70000 years ago the researchers said experts say there is a one in 700000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site previous research found a relatively small magma chamber known as the uppercrustal magma reservoir directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2500 cubic miles 10420 cubic km to discover the latest chamber hsinhua huang from the university of utah and colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5000 earthquakes the researchers said the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock the remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption it sits 12 to 28 miles 19 to 45km beneath the supervolcano and measures 11035 cubic miles 46000 cubic km lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70000 years ago researchers added experts say there is a one in 700000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site previous research found a relatively small magma chamber known as the uppercrustal magma reservoir directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2500 cubic miles 10420 cubic km to discover the latest chamber hsinhua huang from the university of utah and his colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5000 earthquakes these readings combined data from the university of utah seismograph stations which collected shallow readings from nearby quakes in utah idaho the teton range and yellowstone and from the earthscope array which revealed deeper readings from temblors from more further afield each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano the movement and structure of these waves could then be used to map the earth beneath the researchers said in their paper the yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust published in the journal science that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock the remaining two per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption they added it sits 12 to 28 miles 19 to 45km beneath the supervolcano and measures 11035 cubic miles 46000 cubic km to put this into perspective the grand canyon in arizona has a volume of 1000 cubic miles 4168 cubic km meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it twoandahalf times and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times previous research found a relatively small magma chamber known as the uppercrustal magma reservoir beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2500 cubic miles 10420 cubic km the latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles 19 to 45km beneath the surface and measures 11035 cubic miles 46000 cubic km illustrated to discover the large chamber shown in yellow the university of utah tracked seismic waves from 5000 earthquakes each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano the smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcanos caldera  researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million 12 million and 640000 years ago if yellowstone did erupt estimates from a national geographic report said its immediate effects would kill around 87000 instantly a 10foot 3 metre layer of ash would travel around 1000 miles 1610km leaving twothirds of the us uninhabitable this spread of volcanic ash rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe not only do the findings reveal what is causing the high levels of carbon dioxide researchers can use it to learn more about how the supervolcano connects to the hotspot plume in earths mantle it could also provide clues about the structure of other supervolcanoes an understanding of its properties is key to enhancing our knowledge of volcanic mechanisms and corresponding risk said the researchers this lowercrustal magma body has a volume 45 times larger than the uppercrustal magma reservoir and these estimates are critical to understanding the evolution of basalticrhyolitic volcanism and explaining the magnitude of co2 discharge the presence of magma reservoirs underlying upper crust magma chambers has been inferred at other locations but not detected the paper added that the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three yellowstone eruptions 2 million 12 million and 640000 years ago the

that we can see them better now using new techniques added coauthor jamie farrell a postdoctoral researcher at the university of utah for comparison the grand canyon in arizona pictured has a volume

            "cnnthe palestinian authority officially became the 123rd member of the international criminal court on wednesday a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague in the netherlands where the court is based the palestinians signed the iccs founding rome statute in january when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the occupied palestinian territory including east jerusalem since june 13 2014 later that month the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis as members of the court palestinians may be subject to countercharges as well israel and the united states neither of which is an icc member opposed the palestinians efforts to join the body but palestinian foreign minister riad almalki speaking at wednesdays ceremony said it was a move toward greater justice as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice he said according to an icc news release indeed today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace judge kuniko ozaki a vice president of the icc said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute these are substantive commitments which cannot be taken lightly she said rights group human rights watch welcomed the development governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure and countries that support universal acceptance of the courts treaty should speak out to welcome its membership said balkees jarrah international justice counsel for the group whats objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice not palestines decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members in january when the preliminary icc examination was opened israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage saying the court was overstepping its boundaries the united states also said it strongly disagreed with the courts decision as we have said repeatedly we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc the state department said in a statement it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace it said but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as palestine while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office would conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than 2000 people dead the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes cnns vasco cotovio kareem khadder and faith karimi contributed to this report\n",

            "mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21yearold jordan spieth took the firstday honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sunbaked 79th masters for much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34yearold justin rose and 45yearold ernie els as the englishman and the south african posted scores of 67 to tie charley hoffman an american representative of the rank and file last man out jason day would join them in the evening shadows but by then spieth had separated himself from the field to become the youngest firstround leader in masters history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th where he brushed in a 25foot birdie putt runnerup on his debut last year he now owns a threeshot lead going into day two jordan spieth sinks his birdie put on the 18th at augusta to take a threeshot lead into the second round  justin rose made the early running with an impressive fiveunderpar 67  rose consoles gunn yang after the amateur finished his round on 13 over  most of the favoured names left augusta national feeling reasonably content as rory mcilroy and defending champion bubba watson shot 71 while dustin johnson and masters specialist phil mickelson opened with rounds of 70 whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant texan is another matter spieth has barely been off a leaderboard all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the georgia pines into the middle of the fairway it meant when he stood on the parfive 15th tee he was eight under after a scarcely credible 10 single putts on these treacherous greens at that moment anything seemed possible  even a 62 thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155year history of majors only once all day did he act his age and it was here on this riskreward par five as he ran up a six naturally spieth was not about to get greedy i made a mistake but a 64 my first score in the sixties on this course i have nothing to complain about he said a packed crowd watch rose on the 10th green during the first round  rose and charley hoffman above made the early running at augusta with a 67  south african ernie els rolled back the years with a superb 67 on thursday  rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas in nine previous starts rose has led on three occasions after the first round here he equalled his best masters score recorded on the opening day in 2004 that year he went on to hold the 36hole lead as well while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round eventually finishing tied fifth add all those memories of good days here to the fact hes now a proven major champion following his us open triumph in 2013 and there must be the hope this will prove rather more than an excellent opening gambit certainly that is how he is seeing it ive learned plenty from those previous occasions like not getting ahead of yourself he said ive learned that the hard way and now i cant see any reason why i shouldnt keep executing the gameplan youve got to believe in yourself especially when youre a major winner els used his ballstriking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round  rory mcilroy appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with phil mickelson right  mcilroy recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on oneunderpar  rose wasnt the only englishman to prosper as inform paul casey shot 69 i played with paul last week and he strikes me as a man with something to prove said rose after greg norman els might be the great hardluck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here given how good he was at 25 he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable mcilroy will win the masters one day els is still trying at 45 and what a joy to see one of the great ballstrikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his fiveunder score a wonderful eagle three at the 15th was followed by a superlative sand save from a buried lie at the 17th only at the last was there a modicum of disappointment two putts but he took three mcilroy recovered from a nervously played front nine with some familiar augusta failings resurfacing as he failed to birdie either par five two clunked chip shots at the third and sixth also betrayed a level of tension that illustrated fully the momentous nature of the achievement he is trying to complete in shooting for the career grand slam american jordan spieth celebrates with his caddie michael greller on the 18th  defending champion bubba watson struggled to find his rhythm in opening round  tiger woods feels the heat with the world no 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round  woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell  there were also two encouraging moments during that front nine however when he turned what would have been double bogeys in the past into mere bogeys at the parfive second he drove into a hazard and was staring an ugly seven in the face for openers until he got down in two blows from 100 yards at the sixth his mishit chip came back down the steep slope but he didnt panic he decided to take his putter for the second attempt and got down in two the value of limiting the damage was emphasised further when he notched his first birdie of the day at the next on the back nine it was more like it from the 25yearold over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner mickelson but i holed some good putts on the back nine he said i was a little nervous on the front nine but mostly just too excited it was a decent opener the day as a whole was a lot better than that one to savour in fact\n",

message have become legendary since their launch in 2013 the poster will be auctioned off on the day of the ball during the aids solidarity gala in the hofburg palace for the benefit of austrian and international hivaids projects in 2014 the auction of the original photo by david la chapelle sold for 130000 conchita seen behind the scenes on set won over the globe after winning europes biggest entertainment contest in 2014  the life ball which takes place in may is the biggest charity event in europe supporting people with hivaids and is being dubbed europes answer to the met ball thanks to its dazzling guestlist speaking about the origins of the glittering event keszler told femail life ball was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80s and early 90s  particularly in the fashion industry  that saw aids as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about there was this undercurrent of urgency to do something to help to get involved and make some noise my main goal with the first life ball was to bring a spotlight to the disease the fundraising aspect was a secondary consideration the life ball pictured is the biggest charity event in europe supporting people with hiv or aids and is being dubbed europes answer to the met ball  gery keszler set up the event in 1992 with the goal of the show being to be provocative and have hivaids and the taboo that it represented acknowledged right conchita as the star of this years poster  gery keszler left pictured with sir elton john centre set up the life ball in 1992 to raise vital funds  the event which has attracted the likes of bill clinton left and dame vivienne westwood aims to get people talking about aids which keszler says was a daily issue profoundly effecting his friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about  keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific ball tradition that they have in vienna and combine the splendour of the viennese waltz with modern liberal ideals to celebrate life at that time the goal of the show was to be provocative as we were aiming to cause a stir and have hivaids and the taboo that it represented acknowledged he explained when in 1993 one of my clients thierry muglers main stylist died of the disease he agreed to do the fashion show and so life ball as a standalone event was born i had no conceivable idea what i was taking on it was me and a fax machine in six square meters of office space in my clients kitchen i funded it entirely from my own pocket and didnt really know if anyone was going to attend but knew that we had to do something keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific ball tradition that they have in vienna with more liberal ideas conchita wurst pictured at the event prince harry who set up sentebale a charity that provides healthcare and education to vulnerable children in lesotho southern africa will be honoured with an award for his services  as part of his sentebale charity harry built the mamohato childrens centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education and the initiative is being awarded  keszler says this years life ball which takes place in vienna will undoubtedly be better than ever keszler strongly believes that a cure for hiv is on the horizon and hopes to make as much noise about it as possible via his glittering event  from there a huge event was born and the likes of debbie harry kate moss naomi campbell and helena christensen were among the first guests the event is now listed as one of the top 50 hivaids fundraisers in the world and has partnered with elton johns aids foundation bill clintons aids initiative and amfar keszler says this years life ball will undoubtedly be better than ever the event will be continuing its work with elton johns foundation supporting the crucial work that they do and graham norton will be attending as part of the foundation adding some high fashion glamour to the event jean paul gaultier is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work twenty years after he first showed there with gold as this years life ball theme taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque vienna secessionists the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for wellconnected jean paul it is really perfect timing to have jpg back this year said keszler it has been twenty years since he was part of the life ball and we are at such an exciting time in our medical fight against hiv that his presence is a wonderful reminder of how far we have come the event is now listed as one of the top 50 hiv aids fundraisers in the world and has attracted guests such as maria cross left and antonio banderas and naomi campbell right  ricky martin has performed at the event in previous years and 2015 will welcome jean paul gaultier and charlize theron  jean pauls show will be watched from the front row by actress charlize theron who will attend on behalf of her foundation charlize theron africa outreach project theron will join a bevy of alist celebrities and performers who pour into vienna annually to help fight against hiv at the worlds largest aids event the charlize theron africa

swarovski crystal of hope award at the glittering life ball event in may keszler wont stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change  keszler strongly believes that a cure for hiv is on the horizon and that the leap forward that was affordable generic medication was crucial to the fight for survival for the 34 million people in the world living with hiv ironically we have further to go in the fight against social aids than we do the medical disease now shes the bearded diva who won over the globe after winning europes biggest entertainment

public does not want to camilla left to become queen if the prince of wales right succeeds to the throne a daily mail poll reveals  four out of ten people think prince charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to william pictured with his wife the duchess of cambridge prince andrew languishes at the bottom of the popularity table with his brother edward not far ahead camilla and andrew are the only two royals who are more disliked than liked according to the poll despite courtiers efforts to have camilla accepted into the nations hearts 55 per cent are against the duchess of cornwall becoming queen when her husband becomes king this is down from 73 per cent opposition at the time of her wedding to charles in april 2005 but shows she has yet to win over most of the country however she is no longer regarded as the main culprit for the breakup of charless marriage to princess diana the prince himself is held most to blame by 39 per cent followed by diana on 13 per cent and camilla on 12 per cent there is still great affection for diana who died in a paris car crash 18 years ago with a substantial majority saying she would have made a better queen than camilla intriguingly the younger generation is most attached to her even though many of them were not old enough to remember her when she was alive among 18 to 24yearolds two out of three would have preferred diana to be queen while only 3 per cent backed camilla charless wedding to camilla divided the country at the time and ten years on people remain uncertain about its wider significance for the royal family fifteen per cent said the marriage had strengthened the monarchy but 24 per cent believed it had weakened it just over half felt it had no impact camilla 67 was once reviled as the woman whose love affair with charles 66 destroyed his relationship with diana who was 36 when she died in 1997 prince william and his son george  four out of ten people say prince charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to william britain is evenly split on the question of whether charles should succeed to the throne when the queen dies the poll reveals william has the female vote with 43 per cent of women saying he should be the next monarch compared to 37 per cent of men young people are also much more likely to favour the duke of cambridge as king with 53 per cent of 18 to 24yearolds urging his father to step aside but 43 per cent of the public back charles to take over from his mother with a clear majority of over55s wanting him as britains next monarch the findings suggest that support for the prince of wales to wear the crown may actually have dipped slightly in the past decade in 2005 a survey found that 53 per cent of people thought he should be king despite his marriage to camilla and 43 per cent said he should not the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall outside st georges chapel windsor after their civil wedding in 2004  senior officials at clarence house have nurtured the duchesss image with carefully chosen public appearances she has won widespread praise for her charity work dedication to attending royal functions around the country and emergence as a style icon for older women the duchess of cornwall is patron or president of 85 charities and has undertaken nearly 1700 royal engagements in britain and more than 600 abroad since 2005 yet the survey reveals how camillas past continues to affect how she is perceived just over a third said they had grown to like her more over the past decade and nearly twothirds thought charles was happier with her than he ever was with diana prince andew languishes at the bottom of the popularity table  but only a quarter felt the duchess of cornwall had been a good influence on the royal family and a similar proportion argued that her marriage to the prince had stained the royals reputation four in ten say charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to william among those aged 18 to 24 that figure rises to 53 per cent but overall 43 per cent of the public back charles to take over from his mother with a clear majority of over55s wanting him as the next monarch support for the monarchy itself remains very high with the 88yearold queen and the younger royals  william harry and kate  hugely popular by contrast prince andrew was least popular with only 30 per cent liking him charles prince philip and princess anne were ranked in the middle only 19 per cent would back turning britain into a republic although the figure rises to 36 per cent in scotland perhaps a byproduct of the snps unsuccessful independence campaign last year charles who is said to favour a slimmed down monarchy will be buoyed by the finding that 56 per believe that the royals should be reduced to the queens immediate family only by law camilla will automatically become queen consort when charles is king but privately officials continue to debate whether she should use a lesser title to avoid controversy the official position has been that she intends to be known as princess consort but in recent years camilla and charles have dropped a number of hints that they would like her to be queen asked in 2010 whether his wife would take the title charles replied well see wont we that could be the duchess herself says you never know when she faces questions about whether she will become queen nearly twothirds of people thought charles was happier with camilla than he ever was with diana pictured princes william and harry are the most popular members of the royal family the survey found nearly eight out of ten people said they liked the princes with the duchess of cambridge and the queen receiving similarly high ratings women were significantly more likely to approve of the younger royals  84 per cent said they were fans of prince harry compared to 75 per cent of men by contrast prince andrew was the least popular of the royals

            "momentarily he looked his age having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin jordan spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green history was assured he wasnt going to threeputt from there so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36hole score in the history of the masters he wanted it to be more than that though the best it could be the exuberance of youth was kicking in spieth missed for the first time around augusta he made a mild misstep he wheeled away hopped a little almost coltish in his frustration he marched back to his ball prepared to tap it in except it wasnt a real tapin there was a bit still to do and at that point spieth checked he stepped away he marked his ball he let henrik stenson play he did the sensible thing spieth always does the sensible thing that is part of his wonder jordan spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14under 130  spieth leads charley hoffman by five strokes matching the largest halfway lead in masters history  some might think that makes him boring it doesnt make him boring to shoot 14 under the lowest tworound score at augusta and equal to the best 36hole score recorded at a major championship isnt boring we may be watching a sporting phenomenon a performance as breathtaking as tiger woodss arrival in 1997 there will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole if spieth repeats his achievement at the hero world challenge in florida last year perhaps when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par those numbers are unlikely though as the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery his scores are bound to fall against that it will be a lot harder to chase spieths total than just maintain it modern courses have of course been tigerproofed before  but in the short term augusta may need to be spiethproofed too if his scoring stays stable this was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par he has been in the top three players in five of those six too i was a bit out of my comfort zone at the moment on the 18th spieth confirmed i was going to have to work around henriks line so i have to be ready for that and to match their scores now the stress levels can get pretty high still its pretty cool any time you can lead the masters and to set a record is awesome spieth broke raymond floyds 36hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes  at the age of 21 and playing in his second masters spieth looks in complete control  billy horschel spieths playing partner had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day horschel deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message nice hole jordan as they stood on every tee nothing changed overnight many had augusta pegged as the venue where rory mcilroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015 instead this masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young texan gunslinger now in the vanguard of an american revival up ahead of spieth ernie els laboured valiantly to stay in touch it was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career at the age of 25 as mcilroy is now els won his first major the 1994 us open he was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade and he won it again in 1997 by that time however a 21yearold called tiger woods had announced his arrival at the 1997 masters the era of els never materialised mcilroy may have achieved more and younger than els and spieth may not be the icecold winning machine woods was at his age it isnt just that spieth doesnt think like a 21yearold at the 15th a par five and a good birdie opportunity he sensibly laid up and then made four even when he missed he missed cute he has absorbed a lot from his mentor ben crenshaw a fellow texan and augusta expert asked about bens advice on thursday spieth sweetly replied do you mean mr crenshaw there wasnt a hint of irony in his response had he stayed in school he would be studying for his finals right now instead he is fast approaching 10m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major the next tiger that is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders the idea that mcilroy is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked when spieth shot 63 to win the australian open at royal sydney the conditions were windy and inhospitable mcilroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made spieths score geoff ogilvy claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in australia where do spieths first 36 holes stand in the annals at augusta ray floyd played the previous best 36 holes  13 under par  in 1976 spieth now has that record as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18hole lead like mcilroys us open victory at congressional in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books he has barely put a foot wrong nice hole jordan seriously dude name one that wasnt spieth recovers from among the trees at 13 and his caddie michael greller has to hand it to him below\n",

            "and i like me when jean was first diagnosed with spastic diplegia she was considered a textbook case even though her mris and cat scans didnt show any typical symptoms of the disorder and because her neurologist was considered one of the best in the field second opinions never yielded any other conclusions i had been seen by one of the best in the country if not the world and my parents even took me to the leading hospital in the us for a second opinion she recalled they confirmed the spastic diplegia diagnosis and said that my doctor taught all of them jean said she never questioned her original diagnosis and instead chose to accept her physical struggles and focus on living her life to the best of her ability i was never one to dwell on my disability or to think about it too much other than when i was at these doctor appointments she said i guess i was too busy trying to live a normal life and having fun with my friends and family by the time she was 12yearsold jean underwent a very painful muscle transfer to prevent her knees from knocking together when she walked miracle drug jean who was once nearly immobile completed a 10mile hike with her husband pictured four months after she started taking her drd medication known as ldopa  happy family jean is pictured with her husband and their three children following her correct diagnosis of drd  although she compared the physical agony to open heart surgery she said she was glad her parents encouraged her to have the procedure which helped her a great deal and helped to prevent her from tripping over herself when she walked jean who said she still cant get her knees to touch noted that she was happy that it was a permanent procedure although she would have done it again if needed when she was in her late twenties the motherofthree had a pump implanted in her body to distribute medicine but when she ended up overmedicated she visited a specialist who would eventually change her life forever jeans new doctor questioned her original diagnosis and sent her to another neurologist her new neurologist told her she had actually been living with drd noting that most of her symptoms would improve or disappear with a daily dose of a medication known as ldopa the neurologist explained that the symptoms of drd including the involuntary muscle contractions and tremors are often mistaken for cerebral palsy or other disorders but jean couldnt imagine having anything other than spastic diplegia and confessed that she wasnt even going to fill the prescription until her husband persuaded to her to try it when i began taking it a woman who spent 30 years of her life believing that she suffered from cerebral palsy only to learn that she had in fact been misdiagnosed and almost all of her symptoms could be cured with just one pill insists she feels no resentment or anger about her doctors lifechanging error jean sharon abbott 38 from plymouth minnesota was told she had spastic diplegia a form of cerebral palsy when she was just fouryearsold she explained to the mighty but after three decades of suffering from muscle spasms weakness near immobility as well as undergoing painful surgical procedures she learned at the age of 33 that she actually had doparesponsive dystonia drd a rare yet treatable muscle disorder honestly ive never had any negative thoughts about what i went through jean told daily mail online of her misdiagnosis which saw her confined to a bed for much of her childhood scroll down for video  lifechanging error jean sharon abbott can be seen recovering from surgery when she was 12yearsold the 38yearold has now discovered she was misdiagnosed with spastic diplegia a form of cerebral palsy  different life jean who is pictured with her husband l and by herself r used a mobility scooter before she was diagnosed as having doparesponsive dystonia drd a rare yet treatable muscle disorder  while jean admitted that there plenty of times she wished she didnt have to deal with the physical symptoms associated with condition including her dependence on others to complete everyday tasks she noted that she still had a fantastic childhood  thanks in large part to the unwavering support of her family and friends even though i had challenges my parents were so good with dealing with my disability and didnt baby me she explained also i had true friendships that i never had to question all of my life experiences made me who i am today i was the biggest skeptic she said i was expecting no results whatsoever and couldnt imagine a life any other way jean was given what she now knows to be her correct diagnosis on good friday in 2010 and just two days later on easter sunday she stood for the first time without assistance new world jean can be seen using trekking poles during one of her hikes  true love the happy couple posed for a photo when jean still believed she had spastic diplegia  it soon became clear that the medication was working better than jean could have ever imagined as she got stronger her husband began working with her to increase her walking distance and fourth months later they celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary by traveling the 1200 mile road around lake superior  the location of their first honeymoon and not only was jean able to walk to the touristy locations that she previously had to be carried to she was actually able to complete a 10mile hike along with her husband while jean said that they took their time and had snacks along the way she was amazed by her physical accomplishment i was so proud of myself and thought that there are so many people in the world that physically can do stuff like this but choose not to she said and i began to think of all the places i would love to travel with my family that wouldnt have been an option before and while jean realized that there are so many things she wants to try now that she can she still insists that she doesnt have any regrets about receiving her diagnosis so late in life as someone who believes that everything happens for a reason she noted that if she hadnt been diagnosed with cerebral palsy she probably would have chosen a different college meaning she never would have met her husband and had three children with him all i know is ive never been one to live with regrets and i wasnt about to start that thought process as the result of a new diagnosis jean explained plus i can do things that i never would have even considered before so i have no reason to be angry or upset im just so darn happy night out jean was

employee serve as the surrogate over his objections as well as the recommendations of the parties doctor scroll down for video  new development sofia vergara allegedly insisted her 44yearold assistant be the surrogate for her and then fiancée nick loeb despite his reported objections  the new york post column also reported that the american businessman said the actress paid her friend 200000 in gifts and mortgage payments and that a embryo was implanted in the woman on two separate occasions in 2013 with neither surviving a source for the publication added sofía insisted on it she said the assistant was the only person she could trust the insider added that loeb would like to keep the embryos in tact to have his own children he told sofía he would raise the children himself they would be very well taken care of he wouldnt sue her for child support she would have no parental responsibility she refuses to allow him to take charge of the embryos on wednesday it was reported loeb has filed a lawsuit in california in a bid to prevent the modern family actress from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through ivf according to intouch legal fight a magazine claims nick

manganiello have found a surrogate and plan to have children of their own the actress recently told vanity fair magazine that while having another child would be weird it vergara asked that the embryos be destroyed in the event of her death while loeb refused to agree to this condition no agreement was made between the couple about what would happen to any frozen eggs in the event they ended

dollars in foreign government contributions  reported in preceding years those entries were errors according to the foundation  several foreign governments continued to give tens of millions  of dollars toward the foundations work on climate change and  economic development through this threeyear period those governments were identified on the foundations annually updated donor list along

refile when the review is completed craig minassian a foundation spokesman said in an email the clinton foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years  even though it previously received millions pictured bill and hillary speak about the charity last september  the decision to review the returns was made last month  following inquiries from reuters and the foundation has not  ruled out extending the review to tax returns extending back 15  or so years minassian declined to comment on why the foundation had not  included the necessary breakdown of government funding in its  990 forms he said it was rare to find an organization as  transparent as the foundation no charity is required to disclose their donors he said however we voluntarily disclose our more than 300000 donors  and post our audited financial statements on our website along  with the 990s for anyone to see separately the clinton health access initiative chai the

overreported  government grants by more than 100 million some experts in charity law and taxes said it was not  remarkable for a charity to refile an erroneous return once in a  while but for a large global charity to refile three or four  years in a row was highly unusual ive never seen amendment activity like that said bruce  hopkins a kansas city lawyer who has specialized in charity law  for more than four decades referring to the chai filings clinton stepped down from the foundations board of  directors this month but her husband bill clinton and their  daughter chelsea clinton remain directors the foundation said last week after hillary clinton became a  candidate that it would continue to accept funding from foreign  governments but only from six countries that are already  supporting ongoing projects chai will also continue to receive  foreign government funding again with additional restrictions nick merrill clintons spokesman has declined to answer  inquiries about

five years of tax returns after an investigation revealed they had misreported tens of millions of dollars in donations from governments the charities errors generally took the form of underreporting or overreporting donations from foreign governments or in other instances omitted to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue the charities confirmed to reuters which uncovered the mistakes following the discovery the clinton foundation and the clinton health access initiative said they will be refiling multiple annual tax returns and may audit returns extending as far back as 15 years in case there have been other errors the foundation and its donors have been under  intense scrutiny in recent weeks republican critics say the  foundation makes clinton who is seeking the

hodgsons england in dublin this summer the young winger played for ireland at youth level but can still play for the england senior side  jenkinsons superb form at west ham this season has propelled him back into the international reckoning meanwhile an established fixture in the under 21s setup the towering defender has earned calls to reclaim a place in the senior side he is patient however despite his burning desire to add to the one cap he collected against sweden almost three years ago when he came on as a substitute jenkinson harbours an ambition to lead his country to glory at this summers under 21s european championships in czech republic hoping to catch hodgsons eye with next years senior euros not far away jenkinson was in the same predicament as grealish when he had to choose between finland and england  it is a massive opportunity for us he said i think roy hodgson will be watching all the games and having a keen look at all the players the senior euros are a year after so this will be a great chance for us to go and impress when i speak to the lads because i stay in touch with quite a few of them everyone cant wait for it its a massive stage and something that weve worked hard for were confident in ourselves we feel that we can go there and really give it a good go roy hodgson and his staff are believed to be fans of the young winger and want him to commit to england  weve shown in the friendlies weve played recently like against germany and czech republic and weve beaten them we know we can do it its just about going there this summer and reproducing it obviously thats something in the past that weve struggled with as a nation but what a better time to change it and what a great thing it would be to go and win it for now jenkinson is focused on revitalising west hams season having started so impressively reaching the top four at christmas the wheels have fallen off since the turn of the new year jenkinson took part in a short film for betway promoting hammersatthearrers competition  in their past 11 premier league games the hammers have won only once  and that was courtesy of a last minute winner at home to struggling sunderland a month ago the hammers play qpr at loftus road on saturday their london rivals who are fighting for their lives at the foot of the table jenkinson expects it wont be a pretty affair but is confident sam allardyces side can produce the goods to kickstart their charge for an eighth place finish manager sam allardyce also took part and he can be seen preparing to throw a dart  joey obrien from left winston reid and kevin nolan laugh at their teammates attempts  team like qpr are probably even harder than playing teams who are in the top half at this stage its always the same towards the end of the season he said they all pick up points because theyre fighting for their lives at the end of the day  now weve got to be aware of that and we need to be ready for that its going to be a proper scrap at the weekend but well have to dig in if we want to get a result diego poyet looks on as he attempts to score high in the betway darts competition at the training ground  jenkinson showed hes not just a bad footballer with some impressive dart scoring  i think swansea are only four points ahead of us theyre in eighth that would be a fantastic season if we could finish in eighth of course follow your heart thats the advice of carl jenkinson to jack grealish as the young aston villa star weighs up his international future the west ham defender on loan from arsenal until the end of the season knows the predicament that faces the teenager torn between representing the republic of ireland or england jenkinson has experienced an identical international limbo before carl jenkinson left says jack grealish should follow his heart when choosing ireland or england  in 2012 a year after his big move from charlton to the club he supported as a boy  arsenal  the essexborn fullback chose the three lions despite having played for finland the nation of his mother at under 18 and under 21 level it wasnt a decision jenkinson took lightly but it is one he firmly believes was the right decision and now the hammers star 23 is advising boyofthemoment grealish to also do what feels right for him youve got to follow your heart he said speaking exclusively to sportsmail follow where you feel like you belong and play for them that would be my advice thats what i did with the whole englandfinland situation finland were great to me when i was younger and i really enjoyed playing for them the aston villa midfielder centre right has been an instant hit since breaking into the first team  it was a great experience at the time because i was playing against some of the best teams in the world i was only in the charlton reserves yet i was going off to be against all these different countries it was fantastic for me and you can watch the footage exclusively at sportsmail here carl

standing near protesters when someone threw a rock at police officers responded and giordano was unable to get out of the way they just swarmed over me he said i got hit my head hit the ground they were hitting me then someone pulled me out the incident was caught on video which baltimore city paper posted online and reuters photographer sait serkan gurbuz said baltimore police detained him

journalist giordano was released without any charges cell phone video of grays arrest shows him screaming and being dragged with some witnesses saying he looked like his leg was injured baltimore police commissioner anthony batts said he was appalled that gray did not receive proper care immediately he also said officers should have given gray timely medical care multiple times  such as at the site of the arrest and at other times during his transport to the police station batts also said there are no excuses for the fact that gray was not buckled into the transport van but baltimores fraternal order of police lodge 3 shot back these comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioners own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete union president gene ryan said in a written statement five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators batts said the sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions and while the preliminary work on grays autopsy has been completed the medical examiners office is waiting on toxicology results and might ask

            "but you should refrain from doing so if you are excessively tired this is very confusing it is a fact of life that parents or carers of a young infant would be very tired because of the babys erratic sleep pattern it suggests that its okay to go to sleep with your baby if you are not very tired but very few people will sleep unless theyre actually tired the bedsharing guidance does stress that the safest place for a baby under six months to sleep is in their own cot in the same room as its parents but new mothers sometimes struggle with this  especially if they are breastfeeding  because the easiest place to do this is in bed miss james had been to a party and had a little to drink before she her baby and a friend all shared the bed at the family home in neyland west wales in october last year the next morning efan was found face down and unresponsive pembrokeshire coroner mark layton said the current advice on cosleeping is confusing pembrokeshire coroners court heard how attempts were made to resuscitate efan but he could not be saved tests later showed his brain had been starved of oxygenhome office pathologist richard jones told the inquest there was no specific cause of death but it was typical of sudden unexpected infant death or cot death he said the cause of death might be sudden unexplained death in infancy while bed sharing examination showed a suggestion that the brain had an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood shortly before efan died the coroner recorded an open conclusion and said the death could not be explained on pathological grounds adding there is no doubt that he was well cared for and loved by his family sadly it is not uncommon for a baby to die with no obvious cause of death the welsh government said it will consider the coroners comments but said its guidance was very clear and was reviewed by experts last year chief medical officer for wales dr ruth hussey said we will consider the coroners correspondence to us and respond appropriately in due course a spokesman for the national institute for health and care excellence nice which issues health guidelines in england and wales said sharing a bed with your baby at night can aid breastfeeding and in some cultures cosleeping is seen as perfectly normal but the department of health advises that the safest place for a baby to sleep is in a cot the clinical director of the nhs watchdog has admitted guidelines for preventing cot deaths are confusing the national institute for health and care excellence nice published advice for england and wales in december which told parents there was a strong link between cosleeping and cot death or sudden infant death syndrome but guidelines do not tell women they shouldnt bring their babies into bed  even though it makes the risk of death five times higher the watchdog stopped short of telling women not to take babies to bed in case the advice interfered with breastfeeding guidelines professor mark baker nice clinical director said its quite a confusing message it is not clear were not telling people not to cosleep we know that could get in the way with breastfeeding but there is an association there with sudden infant death syndrome he added we are between a rock and hard place the only recommendation we could have made would be to avoid cosleeping the tragic death of a sevenweekold baby in his mothers bed has led a coroner to demand new guidelines to warn parents of the dangers of sleeping next to newborns well caredfor and loved efan james was found lying face down and unresponsive the morning after hannah james 26 took him to bed at the babys inquest this week a coroner in pembrokeshire said new parents were given confusing advice over how tired they could be when they slept in the same bed as their child tragedy efan james who was described as well caredfor and loved was sharing a bed with his mother hannah james pictured together when he died in his sleep last october  cosleeping mrs james had taken her son to bed with her at the family home in milford haven west wales but the next morning he was lying face down and unresponsive an inquest heard  the welsh governments reducing the risk of cot death leaflet which offers similar advice to the nhs in england says parents should not share a bed with a young baby if they feel very tired take drugs smoke or have drunk alcohol but coroner mark layton said the advice is that it is not wrong to share a bed with your baby but it would be seen as incompatible with breastfeeding guidelines there are currently around 300 cot deaths in the uk every year however professor bob carpenter from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine has estimated that around 120 cot deaths could be prevented every year in the uk if parents were advised not to cosleep inquest mr layton recorded an open conclusion and said efans death could not be explained on pathological grounds  but a pathologist said it was

            "kevin gameiro saved his goalkeepers blushes with a late equaliser which put defending champions sevilla into the last four of the europa league beto had looked to have cost his side their progress with the game heading towards extra time before substitute gameiro arrived to slot home with five minutes remaining it had been a risk to start the portuguese keeper but sevilla boss unai emery decided it one he was prepared to take despite betos absence since a game against real madrid in the first week of february carlos bacca slams home the early penalty after vitolo had been brought down by neto after five minute  hulk celebrates his goal with axel witsel but zenit couldnt hold on for extra time in the end  it was a gamble that spectacularly backfired with the keeper gifting zenit two of the softest goals imaginable to see the holders surrender a twogoal lead in the tie first just a matter of seconds after the halftime break with sevilla two goals up on aggregate a cruising beto dropped the ball under no pressure at the feet of salomon rondon allowing the venezuelan to rekindle the tie from a matter of yards then when brazilian forward hulk hit a speculative but not overly threatening shot from 40 yards beto could only flap it over his own line turning the tie on its head and sending it towards extra time but as zenit looked to apply the pressure and beto attempted to atone himself with two stunning saves one from each of the two goalscorers the champions struck on the break bacca is mobbed by his sevilla teammates after putting them in complete control of the tie early on  zenit lodygin criscito neto lombaerts smolnikov garcia witsel danny shatov hulk rondon kerzhakov 83 mins subs not used malafeev rodic anyukov tymoshchuk sheydaev arshavin

navarro reyes  goal bacca 6 gameiro 85  booked iborra  it was a pulsating finish to a game that had started promisingly but looked to have faded away somewhat in the first half the spanish side carried a slim lead given them by a stunning denis suarez volley at the end of the first leg into the second game but zenit were optimistic after scoring an away goal in seville which gave them a perceived edge that advantage lasted little more than five minutes however as defender neto stupidly dived in on sevilla winger vitolo to concede an early penalty it was a bizarre challenge to make with vitolo running towards the byline and the ball not even close to within winning distance the contact may have been minimal but the fact that it was there at all was as much down to netos stupidity as anything else and it was hard to feel sympathy for the portuguese defender carlos bacca was not in the mood to show any mercy dispatching the spotkick beautifully high into the top corner and the visitors were in complete control from then the pattern of play was set with sevilla inviting pressure absorbing it and hitting zenit on the break indeed the visitors two goals ahead on aggregate and with the majority of the game in their own half had much the better chances in the first period coke tries to get a shot away as sevilla threatened on the break before zenit hit back in the second half  zenit midfielder axel witsel challenges sevillas benoit tremoulinas during a tense first half  aleix vidal should have put them further in front after outpacing former manchester city midfielder javi garcia but he seemed to forget that running is not enough failing to either pass or shoot and simply running into yuri lodygin soon after bacca sprang the offside trap and rounded the zenit keeper only to see his shot cleared off the line by igor smolnikov andre villasboas team barely registered a shot before firsthalf stoppage time the one exception coming in the 18th minute when captain danny exchanged passes with hulk before seeing his nearpost shot saved by beto but as the first 45 approached its conclusion the hosts suddenly produced a succession of chances and could easily have got themselves back into the tie salomon rondon whose goal got zenit back in the tie was starved of service for long periods of the game  first salomon rondon almost entirely ineffectual up front in the opening period was gifted the ball three yards from goal following some dubious defending at a set piece but the venezuelan striker couldnt sort his feet out and stumbled the ball away from target moments later danny struck the base of the post with a vicious effort that suggested zenit might have more to offer in the final quarter of the tie not that they could have expected the sort of favours that beto handed them in the second period and which looked to have at least earned them an extra 30 minutes in the end though it was the home sides defending that let them down failing to keep the back door shut as they pushed for a winner allowing gameiro to do the damage\n",

stage of the season and noone gave us a chance said sherwood this week ive had so many people tell me you cant win at white hart lane villa never win there ive been in the pressure of a title race as

longer though demarai gray is wanted by a host of clubs but birmingham are determined to try to keep hold for now  bradley johnson norwich position midfielder age 27 league appearances 37 goals 13 norwich did well to hang on to johnson after being relegated last summer and if they dont make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the premier league where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this a powerful deeplying midfielder with a solid allround game the exleeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons experienced midfielder bradley johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season  troy deeney watford position striker age 26 league appearances 33 goals

more than any other hull defender  no disrespect to dundee united or the scottish premiership but it is widely assumed that the premier league is somewhat of a step up some make it some dont robertson

hand in more goals scored seven assisted two ulloa didnt come cheap yet just because a player costs a handsome fee does not guarantee he will be cut out for the premier league the argentinian with no caps cost 8m and had plenty to prove as he told former club brighton he felt he had to leave to try his luck in the premier league it proved a shrewd move at first the goals may have dried up a little but the striker has performed admirably in his debut season in the top flight nine goals in total as the clubs top scorer yet with leicester bottom of the table ulloa has a task on his hands to help

            "they are one of the most feared animals on the planet now fascinating images reveal how fish make a collective effort to stay out of the way of sharks the striking photographs show a shoal of fish making way for the blacktip shark swimming in the shallow waters of heron island in queensland australia incredible images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark pictured perhaps proving that they are instinctively frightened of it  it is thought that the reef shark was not interested in catching a meal but the fish naturally keep their distance creating circles of clear water around the predator dr ken collins senior research fellow and diving officer at the university of southampton told mailonline this is fairly typical behaviour for shoaling fish the same would happen if it were a diver in the photograph rather than a shark something big is automatically accepted as a potential threat and swimming in a swirling dense shoal is a defensive move which provides mutual protection simply reducing the chances of an individual being picked off and confusing the potential enemy flocks of small birds will react the same way to hawks fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour such as keeping safe from predators as well as boosting their chances of feeding and finding a mate its known that shoals of fish can change shapes and directions in seconds  as if they are thinking as one  and in these images the fish manage to keep a pocket of clear water between themselves and the shark even the pocket does change shape software engineer scott carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the shark the photos show a shark swimming in the shallow waters where they are guaranteed a clear path because terrified fish move out of their way  software engineer scott carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across fish trying to avoid the shark off heron island in queensland australia marked its thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators jaws because they confuse larger creatures the predator confusion effect is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because similarlooking fish create a sensory overload for predators fin movements made by a shoal seem to overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking the fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way the lookout is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group luckily the 32yearold was carrying his camera to snap the scene there were four blacktip reef sharks circling the area and there was one other type of shark  a lemon shark he said we walked along the jetty looking down at a large school of fish just beneath the jetty we noticed a number of reef sharks patrolling the area near the jetty and as we watched the reef sharks slowly moved into the school of fish with the fish retreating away from the immediate area around the shark this progressed for about 15 to 20 minutes and a lemon shark joined in on the action late in the piece it seems like the fish are well aware of the threat and are trying to keep a safer distance from it they want to avoid being eaten he noted that the sharks were remarkably calm when moving though the fish it was certainly not what i would describe as a feeding frenzy at the time there was an occasional swift manoeuvre to attempt to catch a fish and the sharks were successful in some of these attempts he added watching the continuous parting of the school of fish as each shark moved through the mass of fish was absolutely spectacular whether fish feel fear illustrated by a still from the film finding nemo is a slippery question for scientists some studies claim that fish feel pain but shoaling behaviours thought to be purely instinctive  software engineer scott carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the sharks pictured left and right near a jetty  whether fish have emotions is a slippery question for scientists whose studies have shown that they can feel pain in an abstract way as well as other emotions whether fish feel fear or simply act instinctively they swim in large shoals that offer individuals more protection from predators than going it alone shifts in the shape of the shoal is thought to be driven by feeding travelling and avoiding predators its thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators jaws because they confuse larger creatures proposed in 1978 the predator confusion effect is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predators visual channel  a theory thats been proved in the wild and in computer simulations there is also a theory that fin movements made by a shoal overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking its possible that if one shark was found among the shoal pictured and others around it they could act collectively to corral a shoal for a quick meal the fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way the lookout is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group its possible that if one shark was found among the shoal and others around it they could act collectively to corral a shoal this behaviour isnt common in sharks but dolphins have been shown to surround and herd fish as a group while individuals take it in turns to swim through the shoal eating unlucky members corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured and atlantic bottlenose dolphins even chase fish onto mud banks for an easy meal in the shark world thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fish before striking they confine lots of fish in a small space by swimming round them and then splash then strike them with the upper lobe of the tail to stun them\n",

            "a milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the eu to scrap quotas restricting production  a milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the eu to scrap quotas restricting production the quota system was abolished today after 30 years  allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty the move is expected to drive a spike in production particularly in countries like ireland germany and the netherlands who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the uk as a result a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out bringing down the price for consumers however british farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses milk quotas were introduced in 1984 to address the oversupply during the late 1970s and early 1980s that had led to the infamous milk lakes and butter mountains farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties the new freeforall will promote dairy factory farms where supersize holstein cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs the industrialisation of dairy farming has seen the number of uk farms producing milk fall from 50000 to 14116 over the last 30 years at the same time the average herd has risen from 64 cows to 134 the average milk production from holstein dairy cows which have been labelled udders on legs has risen by 55per cent to 7327 litres per animal per year  around 12900 pints in some cases this has been done through selective breeding programmes designed to create supersize cows which are bulked up with high protein feed and kept inside for much of the year in what are known as zero grazing barns dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint making it cheaper than some bottled water some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings chairman of the dairy board at the national farmers union rob harrison has urged all eu countries to act responsibly and collectively in order to manage future volatility mr harrison said farmers and dairy processors here do have some concerns about how other eu countries will react to the ending of quotas some are rapidly increasing their output without an end market for these goods with milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the eu and stall any recovery in the dairy markets its vital that expansion in any member state is planned in accordance with available market opportunities dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint making it cheaper than some bottled water  mr harrison said the new freedom could allow british dairy farmers who are particularly efficient to win new sales in europe and around the world particularly the far east he said we also need uk dairy processors to recognise and promote potential markets both at home and abroad and look to develop new products such as sports drinks the idea of milk being promoted as a sports drink has been given credence by cocacola which has recently launched its own brand of milk in the united states the new fairlife milk costs more than twice as much as regular milk but the firm believes consumers will pay more on the basis it contains 50per cent more protein and half the sugar earlier this week some european farmer groups mounted a protest over the changes outside the european parliament in brussels which involved a funeral march the lighting of a warning fire the european milk board a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way its president romuald schaber said the changes are a particular threat to small dairy farmers who tend to have higher costs chronic price collapses are inevitable the next crisis is on its way he said prices will be rockbottom as europes farmers will have even less market power to achieve a costcovering milk price in the future maria heubuch an mep for the greens warned about the loss of small farmers europe could see more factory farms with 1000 2000 or even 5000 cows merely providing raw materials for the industry she said the european dairy association which represents milk processors has backed the end of quotas its secretary general alexander anton said it goes without saying that the end of the quota will lower the administrative burden on all levels this will naturally further enhance the competitiveness of the whole sector irish dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big inroads to the british market a study by the irish farmers association ifa estimated the ending of quotas would create 9500 extra jobs in ireland and at least 13 billion euros 950m in extra exports while productions restrictions have been scrapped the eu will provide a safety net for dairy farmers brussels will have the power to buyin butter and skimmed milk powder at a guaranteed figure if there is oversupply which will shore up the price\n",

ear to that on monday but a handful of people repeated the familys message they became criers in the desert against countless young people flinging rocks at police breaking windows looting and setting fires the peacemakers  clergy grays family and brave residents  placed themselves in the rioters way their message was the same i want them all to go back home said rev jamal bryant its disrespect to the family the family was very clear  weve been saying it all along  today there was absolutely no protest no demonstration he said but the messengers were a finger in a dam that quickly crumbled as rowdy groups swelled into a full urban riot it overshadowed the message peaceful protesters delivered on prior days  justice for gray the 25yearold africanamerican man died from spinal injuries after being arrested earlier this month the early fits of violence came in the afternoon about the time mourners left grays memorial services blocks away rev bryant said they bumped right into it for us to come out of the burial and walk into this is absolutely inexcusable he said he did not want to see it spread to downtown baltimore where some rioters said it would and organized people to stand in the way we have a line of gentlemen from the nation of islam to build a human wall as well as men from the christian church making that human wall he said but as crowds turned into multitudes the intervention became a drop in the bucket by compare and police lines were also no match as officers in riot gear receded flames engulfed cars and stores and roared out of apartment buildings into the night sky a senior living facility under construction by a baptist church burned to the ground the blazes stretched the fire departments resources as at least 30 trucks deployed looters streamed into a cvs bodegas and liquor stores and walked out with what they could carry a young man in a blue sweatshirt tried to talk people down by himself he walked up to cnn correspondent miguel martinez as a store nearby was being looted it later went up in flames the man who didnt say his name was disgusted at what was happening in his neighborhood and disappointed in the police response to rioting there was a line of police down the street not far away they could have moved down here to stop it he told martinez the gray familys lawyers again put the familys wish out to the public that there be no protests that day let alone violence its marring the cause and hope for change that may have come out of the investigation into freddie grays death said family attorney mary koch thats just disintegrated into just looking at baltimore city and thinking that the city is the city of violence she said against all odds a handful of individuals kept trying to stop it a tall adult man walked up to a young man who was confronting riot police he slung an arm over his shoulder turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines im just a soldier said valentine he told cnns joe johns that he was a veteran of the vietnam war young people had no business on the streets he said they need to be in their home units studying and doing something with their lives even baltimore members of the crips and bloods two street gangs renowned for drug dealing and extensive violent crime  and for killing each other  came together with others who condemned the rage that swept through their neighborhoods the guys who pulled me aside are selfidentifying as crips and say they dont approve of whats happening this is our community wrote baltimore sun reporter justin fenton on his confirmed twitter account gangs members joined community leaders and grays family for a press conference monday night on the stage at new shiloh baptist church which had held grays funeral an announcer thanked them for coming to the church the gangs have signed a peace deal and are uniting to push against police lines in protests according to a report by the daily beast rev bryant also mentioned their peace treaty but police say the gangs purpose goes much further  that they and another gang called the black guerilla family plan to take out law enforcement officers police said this is a credible threat the gangs are consistently pursued by the fbi at the end of the day grays family had the last word on the violence at the press conference it wasnt good to see that it turned into all this violence and destruction i am appalled said richard shipley grays stepfather i want yall to get justice for my son but dont do it like this here said grays mother gloria darden who wore a tshirt with her sons photo i dont think thats for freddie his twin sister fredericka gray said i think the violence is wrong after their comments gray family lawyer william h murphy took the microphone violence is not the path to change he said then he got back to the message than had been bitterly marred by the rioting murphy asked for a show of hands in the church audience of people who had experienced police brutality or personally knew someone who did all but but as they strolled past a crowd a young man behind them hurled a stone at police putting his whole body into the throw at least one young man paid the price for his participation when his mother turned up to spank him home before running cameras she slapped him in the head again and again driving him away from the crowd as she cursed police commissioner anthony batts later thanked her i wish i had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight he said after night fell giving way

            "a map that reveals every official sighting of a ufo over the past 76 years  suggests that we are experiencing more cosmic traffic than ever before many of the sightings can be put down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies but some enthusiasts believe it is because of rise in alien activity the interactive map was created by writer levi pearson who used a ufo sighting dataset from the national ufo reporting centre and open source software from cartodb click on the map below to find out if aliens have been spotted in your neighbourhood  a map shows sightings of extraterrestrials around the world in the last 76 years  and seems to suggest we have more cosmic visitors than ever it was created by writer levi pearson who used a ufo sighting dataset from the national ufo reporting centre and open source software from cartodb  published in the quantbait website it begins in 1933 with the first ufo sightings being spotted over california and nebraska in the us the uk and france in europe and locations in japan and australia the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s across the world according to the map in the us sightings documented during the 1940s include the famous battle of los angeles and roswell ufo incident on february 25 1942 radar operators spotted a ufo within 120 miles 193km  of los angeles that moved at incredible speed before vanishing the ufo map pictured was created by writer levi pearson who used a ufo sighting dataset from the national ufo reporting centre and open source software from cartodb its shows that the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s  explanations for ufo sightings are just as vague as for aliens themselves and could be down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies  or a genuine rise in alien activity an illustration of a flying saucer is pictured  the map shows a dramatic rise in the number of ufo sightings during the 1950s and 1960s while this could indicate ore alien activity the cia recently claimed that half of ufo sightings in the us were linked to them testing u2 spy planes pictured at altitudes of 60000 ft  an artillery officer said he saw 25 craft flying at 25000ft 7620 metres and other eye witnesses reported seeing swarms of balloonshaped objects flying at around 200mph 320kmh fearing the city was under attack officials fired at the aircraft but no evidence of damage was ever found prompting people to speculate the ufos were from another world and in 1947 the roswell incident occurred which is still the source of speculation today the us military claimed they recovered a secret research balloon that had crashed but conspiracy theorists say the wreckage of an alien craft was discovered and hidden while its possible that there were more ufo visitations during the decade officials at the time put it down to people being nervous about world war ii and seeing objects in the sky nigel watson author of the ufo investigations manual told mailonline sightings of strange things in the sky have been reported for centuries though it was only with them being labelled as flying saucers or ufos that people began to realise that this is a worldwide phenomenon ufo sightings often come in sudden and shortlived periods which ufologists call flaps or waves often specific locations seem to be highly attractive to ufos and these locations are known as ufo window areas or ufo portals the british version of roswell reportedly took place over christmas in 1980 it occurred in rendlesham forest suffolk next to raf military bases soldiers reported unusual lights and when they investigated found a metal object with coloured lights ufo map of uk shown thanks to the rise in popularity of scifi films and an increase in ufo sightings aliens were very much in the public consciousness in the 1960s here dr h allen hyneck an astrophysicist at  northwestern university says at a press conference in 1966 that a photo claiming to show a ufo is a time exposure of the crescent moon and the planet venus  the british version of roswell reportedly took place over christmas in 1980 it occurred in rendlesham forest which is next to raf military bases soldiers reportedly saw unusual lights and when they investigated found a metal object with coloured lights but as they approached the craft it moved away frightening farm animals the incident is unexplained but some people say the lights were reflections from a nearby lighthouse and the craft may have been a secret weapon on march 31 1992 high speed white objects were spotted in the skies and an officer at raf cosford and shawbury spotted a large triangular craft hovering at 200ft which was humming and shining a spotlight the incident was reported to the ministry of defence and sceptics say it could be explained by a nearby police tracking helicopter or a russian rocket reentering the atmosphere in the uk warminster cannock chase and bonnybridge are the most famous ufo window areas bonnybridge is known as the ufo capital of scotland and there are said to be some 300 sightings every year although not all of these are shown on the map cannock chase in the midlands has been a ufo hotbed since the1960s when there were first reports of a crashed craft and earlier this year residents reported seeing slowmoving aircraft making a loud buzzing noise moving across the sky there appear to be repeated ufo sightings in the midlands shown on the map during the 1960s with clusters of activity also seen in the netherlands germany and other parts of central europe there is a marked increase in sightings on the map during the 1950s and 1960s all across the us shown on the map it is worth noting however that some famous sightings are missing such as reports of flying saucers over washington dc in 1952 last year the cia took credit for half of the ufo reports in the 1950s and 1960s and as scifi films gained popularity such as invaders from mars 2001 a space odyssey and invasion of the body snatchers its possible aliens were higher in the public conscious than ever before the cia said that ufo sightings were directly correlated to them testing u2 spy planes at altitudes of 60000 ft 18288 metres  a feat of engineering that was not possible before reports suggest that the cia soon realised that ufo sightings lined up with the place and time the u2 planes were flying but that they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens to keep the tests firmly under wraps however this does not explain the 1966 westall encounter in australia when some 200 students and teachers in melbourne claim to have seen a ufo land in a suburban field before taking off again but once again sceptics say the ufo was an experimental military aircraft the map also shows a famous ufo sighting in sao paulo brazil in 1986 when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 ufos which showed up on radar the mysterious flying objects disappeared when fighter jets gave chase leading some people to say the ufos were technicallysuperior alien craft however a british space researcher called geoffrey perry claimed that the ufos were actually pieces of debris thrown out of the soviet space station salyut7 which burned up in the atmosphere stylist reported in europe the map shows many sightings over belgium between 1989 and 1990 which is known as the belgium wave at that time some 13500 people claimed to have seen huge black triangles flying silently through the skies while the incident was tracked by nato radar and investigated by the countrys military nothing unusual was found and sceptics believe the sightings may have been of ordinary helicopters from the mid1990s onwards the explosion of sightings intensify on the map with large concentrations over the west coast and the whole eastern half of the us from texas the map shows the whole of europe ablaze with circles indicating ufo sightings as well as areas of western africa india south east asia and south america some believe that the increase in sightings over the past 20 years could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before ufo map focused on australia pictured the map shows a famous ufo sighting in sao paulo brazil in 1986 when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 ufos as well as numerous sightings in south africa and other parts of the continent which have been reported in recent years ufo maps of south america left and africa right are shown  the global nature of the sightings suggests this could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before mr watson said with the coming of the internet it is easier for people to report ufo sightings and this is probably one reason for a rise in sightings we should also acknowledge that chinese lanterns and the increased deployment of drones are responsible for greater amounts of sightings in 2008 a guard at yeni kent compound in turkey claimed to have filmed ufos and the footage is said by some to be among the most important ufo images there is no explanation for the encounter in a similar way to a sighting in warden in south africa where a police officer said he saw an enormous ovalshaped orange light in 2000 in 2007 eyewitnesses in kolkata india said they saw a fastmoving glowing  object which was a cross between a sphere and a triangle and in 2013 in bracknell berkshire two glowing flying saucers were photographed hovering in the skies above a pub and new of visitors quickly spread online john wickman chairman of the british ufo association bufora said technology is vastly progressing and a very large number of sightings no matter where they are in the world can be attributed to modern military craft that have been misidentified just because a ufo report is made does not mean that the object originates from anywhere other than the earth he cautioned mr watson said on the other hand the internet allows access to greater amounts of information and enables us to discuss reports from lots of different angles from the extreme sceptical viewpoints to the most outlandish conspiracy rumours with or without the internet ufologists tend to think that only five to 10 per cent of sightings are of anything exotic and worthy of further investigation\n",

            "but having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest in this case mr gray took off running the united states supreme court and maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight  running away from the police for no reason  is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed when you add to the suspects flight the supreme courts recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop constitutionally much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual 1 running away 2 in a high crime area the stop will usually be good but police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be armed and presently dangerous to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons the charging document doesnt really identify a safety concern  or does it after the chase and before an arrest this officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket shouldnt that really say i saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket  where i couldnt see it thats a close call police were lawfully at the stop stage but the knife  even though it was inside his pants pocket  was visible from the outside  because of an identifying knife clip see how artfully that was done observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern observation of a clip i suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket  assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips chip clips etc according to william murphy an attorney for grays family he was carrying a pocket knife of legal size and the lawyer contended that police didnt see the knife before the altercation the legality of the knife will be an issue but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop the important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest in theory if a stop gives rise to no suspicion and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint the citizen should be free to leave an arrest requires much more probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and nothing less that knife was the only crime he was charged with so again police are locked into a narrative by their own report if it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest for example if the knife was one of those pointy files attached to a 2inch nail clipper that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest remember also that based on the police narrative in the report they did not see the knife until after they seized mr gray so the question arises what would they have done with gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him they could but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in grays death as weve seen charging officers with crimes  especially murder  is rare and difficult if youre procop you could say thats because they are welltrained and rarely abuse their force if you have a more jaded view of law enforcement you would say its because they are welltrained and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force baltimore police are suggesting mr grays injuries occurred after his arrest while he was being transported back for processing and that he may not have received proper medical attention thats not a surprise in fact from a liability perspective this is a good strategic move for the police it will be harder to hold them liable if grays injuries happened after  not before  his arrest prearrest grays seizure would be judged by a reasonableness standard under the fourth amendment however courts have limited these seizures to the initial act of seizing the person any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the fourth amendment the claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision the due process clause of the 14th amendment so what whats the difference between the fourth and 14th amendment anyway when it comes to potential civil liability of the officers it makes a huge difference the applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs under the fourth amendment the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances under the 14th amendment standard the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering thats a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet fortunately courts have held that pretrial detainees like freddie gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th amendment as are convicted prisoners under the eighth amendment and its prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners confused youre not alone even a supreme court justice has taken issue with this view of the constitution other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the fourth amendment after arrest so not only could reasonable minds differ  reasonable courts judges and states differ too its just that maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions but its true its a kind of unintentional gap in constitutional coverage one the courts have struggled to deal with based on the law it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a rough ride police might avoid liability in maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically thats a higher standard for liability than if freddie gray was hurt prearrest the 25yearold was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in according to authorities grays family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped and after a week of hospitalization he died police commissioner anthony batts has said we know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times the police and the us justice department are investigating the case raises at least three legal issues  believe it or not the charging document in this case gives us more information than the nowviral video of the arrestin that narrative police state defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence according to the officers words thats the sole reason a stop was initiated there is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns  the next sentence is important too the defendant was apprehended in a specific location after a brief foot chase  the police are locked in it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop because the very next thing that happensis the stop can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them for the most part\n",

            "cnnauthorities in south carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of walter scott but the footage does not show the actual shooting video from the patrol car of north charlestons michael slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and scott slager approaches scotts vehicle the two men speak scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle slager then returns to his patrol car scott exits his vehicle briefly and slager tells him to stay in the car scott then gets out of the car again and runs away out of the range of the dash cam the video which was released thursday also shows a passenger in scotts car the passengers identity was not given in a police report obtained by cnn but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle scott family attorney chris stewart told cnn the man with scott was a coworker and friend he did not identify the friend by name when asked what might have motivated scott to run justin bamberg another attorney for the family speculated that scott might have been concerned about child support issues scott owed back payments on child support totaling 1810443 according to charleston county family court documents obtained by cnn he had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by slager but bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened this dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed mr scott  that shooting was completely unjustified and that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit the lawyer said the north charleston police department is not providing more information citing an ongoing investigation of scotts killing thats being conducted by the independent south carolina law enforcement division sled many questions remain about what happened on saturday when officer slager pulled scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight in the police report that cnn obtained a responding officer said that slager said that at one point he started to chase scott down a street shots fired and the subject is down the officer writes that slager said he took my taser but a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw scott try to get slagers taser feidin santana was walking to work when he saw slager and scott struggle on the ground he told nbcs lester holt on wednesday santana then took out his phone and started recording video i remember the police officer had control of the situation he had control of scott santana said then santana said he heard the sound of a taser it seemed to santana that scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the tasered again on thursday a second witness spoke to cnn about what she saw gwen nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and curious she followed them she saw scott and slager at the entrance to a vacant lot it was like a tussle type of thing like you know like what do you want or what did i do type of thing said nichols who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw i didnt hear mr slager saying stop  she said feidin showed the video to the scott family but santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape in interviews with msnbc and nbc santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video i  thought about erasing the video santana told msnbcs all in with chris hayes in an interview that aired wednesday evening i felt that my life with this information might be in danger the video shows slager shooting eight times at scott as scott runs away witness i nearly erased shooting video out of fear  an autopsy showed that scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body before the officer starts firing his gun in the video a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground its not clear whether that is the taser later in the video when the officer approaches scotts body he drops a dark object next to the man its also not clear whether that is the taser its unknown whether scott took the officers taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body slager has been fired and charged with murder he is white scott who was unarmed was black timeline of events  scotts shooting stirred memories of the michael brown case in ferguson missouri where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer a grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case but not everyone agreed that scotts case is like browns or that race was a factor asked how he felt about slager being charged with murder santana answered that no one can feel happy he has his family and mr scott also has his family he told holt and i was sickened by what i saw north charleston police chief eddie driggers told reporters wednesday mayor keith summey spoke at the same news conference which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted no justice no peace they called for the mayor to step down summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras so every officer on the street in the city will have one that is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered he said just before the conference was set to begin demonstrators walked in they were led by a man wearing a black lives matter tshirt who shouted this is what democracy looks like 2010 census data show that north charleston is 47 black and 42 white the makeup of the citys police department is unclear though its been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80 black three of 10 city council members are black its unclear what slagers motivation was or if race played a part in scotts slaying we cant get into the brain of another individual so we cant state that scott family attorney stewart said i think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature if convicted slager could face life in prison or the death penalty who is officer slager an autopsy of scott showed that he sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body and his death was the result of a homicide the charleston county coroners office said asked whether cpr was performed on scott after slager shot him driggers said in the end of it the video the videotape shows his brother was running for his life away from the officer i think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot no one would have thought that scott said family members have adamantly repeated that they dont want

            "i let them all know they could eat if they like and if not return it to my desk and shook all their hands as they left the room when it comes to this crucial stage in the season you need all your troops ready to follow orders its a zayn if theyre not pulling in one direction  at whatever level its always important to have all your players going in one direction just like the band if youve got one person wanting to go a different way do a different thing something is going to crack and the team ethic and unity will be broken at the business end of the season it is so important that they are working as a team people have to do their jobs defending set plays defensive shape when youre attacking working up and down the pitch you need good captains and leaders within your group people like john terry who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that chelsea squad follows jose mourinhos guidance out on the pitch it is one direction or no direction captain john terry works hard to ensure everybody at chelsea is heading in the same direction  on the periphery  having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important but the players out of the team on the periphery can lose you matches negative body language people unable to cope with not playing disruptive comments and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad the manmanagement of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the uefa pro licence or courses put on by the football association ive spent the last threeandahalf years working with a guy called rob northfield who runs inspire based up in harrogate on manmanagement skills for my players my staff and of course myself he deals with chief executives of the infamous banks and building societies allen won a championship with gillingham and is hoping to soon do the same with barnet  since then i have one championship in the bag at gillingham and hopefully by the end of this month wouldve bagged a second without rob northfields this would not have happened mourinho is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side he knows at some point in the season he will need them and they are always fighting for him players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing allens analysis  one person i keep hearing about gary rowett gary rowett is winning so many games and doing so well at birmingham city he has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the championship he did a tremendous job at burton albion and back then there was no doubt in my mind having played against his teams over the last couple of years he would go on to manage at a much higher level he mustve asked me at least one hundred questions when my gillingham team visited burton the week after winning the championship he was like bamber gascoigne the old university challenge presenter  nonstop firing questions at me he was listening to the answers and asking intelligent questions about how we managed to win the league with gillingham from a team that had previously been midtable for me hes heading for the top allen believes birmingham city manager gary rowett is going to go all the way to the top  one thing id change about perceptions in football  at barnet last summer i found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people i took on jon nurse born in barbados as a playercoach i was impressed when he told me how when he was a teenager he lost his mum and he had the responsibility to bring up his younger brother on top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games winning a promotion the fa trophy and been in numerous playoff finals he also has a uefa b coaching licence and a schoolboy skills training academy called love the ball then i was introduced to a young man called omar yabroudi who moved to london from dubai and wanted to be my analyst he works hard and has been a real help he works for virtually nothing and has fitted in superbly we have a 23yearold female physiotherapist jade cook who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time she is calm quiet wellorganised disciplined structured and i am very happy all the players are being so well looked after i did not take on a barbadian an irishman an emirati or a female because of their nationality or skin colour or gender i took them on because theyre good at their jobs they are good people with good personalities and they have excellent characters im very proud of all of them in their first year working for me and no doubt all four will go on to work at the top level in the premier league without them we would not have been top of the conference for so long the big issue england coming out of the dark ages when i was a little boy watching england versus poland in the front room with my dad the amazing jan tomaszewski who brian clough called a clown in gloves stopped england qualifying for the 1974 world cup with his heroic performance in goal the panel of pundits all those years ago said weve got to change were not playing the type of football other countries play our children dont get coached to be good technical players like other nations over the years ive heard it time and time again the same old stuff especially over the last few years with the spanish dominance people asking why we have not got the iniestas and xavis of this world on our shores allen believes greg dyke is the man to help find the iniestas and xavis of the english game  the football associations technical director now dan ashworth appointed by my old chairman greg dyke is a forwardthinker who can finally make some changes he may never have played a professional game in his life but at west bromwich albion he implemented a modern football structure at the club where the manager does not have to deal with everything where other departments and professionals are involved greg dyke speaks to premier league chief richard scudamore ahead of his fa council meeting  ashworth can handle himself well at a league managers association training day a couple of years at a hotel near reading one sunday afternoon speaking just before fabio capello ashworth faced a roomful of sceptical oldfashioned managers that thought they knew best and thought they knew the way forward the gave him a torrid time with their cavemanlike mentality that the manager should run the whole club he handled the room carefully and skilfully martin mad dog allen returns with his latest column for sportsmail the barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season taking the biscuit  just a few days ago an old friend of mine jimmy carter the winger who played for millwall liverpool and arsenal not the us president visited barnet and left me a nice packet of milk chocolate biscuits in my office after training to help me get rid of them i decided to give some out to our players the first seven who walked past my office door were called in for a cup of pg tips and a chat i asked each one to take a biscuit and pass the pack on around the group i kept repeating it each time take one and pass it on take one and pass it on one player didnt want a biscuit and simply passed the packet on martin allen believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season i stopped them in their tracks and asked him why he hadnt taken a biscuit this was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coachs

            "for many of those concerned about the future of the planet giving up meat is seen as a major way for people to reduce the impact they have on the environment producing beef for example requires large amounts of water land for grazing and emits tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere but now bill gates the billionaire founder of microsoft and philanthropist has said it may in fact be possible to keep eating meat and still care for the planet scroll down for video  bill gates a failed vegetarian says the worlds demand for meat can be met with moderation and innovation in his most recent blog post the worlds richest man has defended meat eating saying was unrealistic to expect large numbers of people to become vegetarian he also explains that some of the impacts of meat farming have been overstated instead he believes it will be possible to provide enough meat for the worlds growing population as demand in developing countries increases scientists have already cooked up the first test tube beef burger but now researchers in israel are working on the worlds first labgrown chicken professor amit gefen a bioengineer at tel aviv university  has begun a yearlong feasibility study into manufacturing  chicken in a lab funded by a nonprofit group called the modern  agriculture foundation which hopes cultured meat will one day  replace the raising of animals for slaughter the foundations cofounder shir friedman hopes to have  produced a recipe for how to culture chicken cells by the end  of the year the researchers say their task is more difficult than  producing the first labgrown hamburger a 300000 beef patty  cooked up at maastricht university in the netherlands after five  years of research financed by google cofounder sergey  brin to make the beef burger muscle fibers were grown in the lab from stem cells taken from a cow these tiny chunks were then combined to make the beef burger those who tasted it said it was like meat but not juicy professor gefen however is hoping to make a whole piece of  chicken starting from a single cell he said although it might be possible to get people in richer countries to eat less or shift toward lessintensive meats like chicken i dont think its realistic to expect large numbers of people to make drastic reductions evolution turned us into omnivores but there are reasons to be optimistic for one thing the worlds appetite for meat may eventually level off consumption has plateaued and even declined a bit in many rich countries including france germany and the united states i also believe that innovation will improve our ability to produce meat the consumption of meat has met with considerable criticism in recent years as climate change experts have warned about the harm it is doing to the planet a recent report from chatham house said that the global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than cars planes trains and ships combined the intergovernmental panel on climate change also found that dietary change was also necessary to substantially lower emissions lord stern the economist appointed by the british government to assess the financial impacts of climate change has also urged people to give up meat however calls for widespread vegetarianism have been deeply unpopular with the general public some researchers have also estimated that it takes several thousand litres of water to produce just one kilogram of beef due to the water needed to grow feed for them cattle like those above and other livestock produce more greenhouse gas globally than transport emissions  bill gates has invested some of his fortune into projects aimed at finding sustainable solutions to problems in poverty stricken areas of the world including turning sewage water into clean drinking water shown above this makes livestock farming increasingly difficult in areas hit by drought cattle grazing can also take valuable land that could be used to grow more affordable agricultural crops demand for meat is expected to soar over the next 30 years or so with global beef consumption rising from 64 million tonnes in 2005 to 106 million tonnes in 2050 according to the food and agricultural organisation of the united nations it also says pork demand will rise from 100 million tonnes to 143 million tonnes and chicken consumption will increase from 82 million tonnes to 181 million tonnes however mr gates who set up the bill and melinda gates foundation with his wife to fund research into sustainable technology that can tackle poverty around the world said some of the impacts of meat have been overstated he points to research that suggests most of the water needed for livestock production is known as greenwater which is used to grow grass global demand for beef like the steak above is expected to soar to 181 million tonnes by 2050 but mr gates says that it should be possible to meet this as some of the environmental impacts of meat are overstated  most of this green water comes from rainfall and also evaporates back into the atmosphere meaning it is not lost he said one study that excluded green water found that it takes just 44 litres  not thousands  to produce a kilo of beef mr gates has also been funding new research projects aimed at producing meat substitutes and says he has been impressed with the results companies like beyond meat and hampton creek foods have been experimenting with turning plant proteins into foods that taste and look like meat and eggs mr gates also explains that he once dabbled with being vegetarian himself in his late twenties but found he couldnt keep it going he argues that meat is an important source of nutrition needed to help children develop healthy and said it was important that people in developing countries have access to these foods he said with a little moderation and more innovation i do believe the world can meet its need for meat\n",

            "new lease of life karen bane with her daughter jessica after undergoing the alternative procedure  it is a painful and embarrassing condition that affects millions of british women pelvic organ prolapse or pop occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs  including the womb  becomes weak typically after childbirth complications include an uncomfortable dragging or full feeling discomfort during sex or stress incontinence although up to half of women are thought to suffer to some degree far fewer seek help and many who do are offered just one solution a hysterectomy while surgical removal of the reproductive organs solves the immediate problem it also ends fertility and with three months of recovery needed it is no quick fix now a leading gynaecologist has claimed thousands of patients may be undergoing the drastic operation needlessly he is one of a growing number of surgeons who claim not enough women are offered the alternative a halfhour keyhole procedure that uses an implanted mesh sling made from nylon to lift and hold the womb back in place providing a permanent solution to a prolapse and preserving fertility the procedure called a sacrohysteropexy is rare with just 1072 admissions for the surgery in the past three years by contrast there were 145310 admissions to hospitals in england in the past three years for hysterectomies due to conditions such as fibroids pelvic pain or cancer according to the health and social care information centre surgeon jonathan broome who has performed more than 1000 sacrohysteropexies in the past 15 years has called for the option to be made more widely available on the nhs so women of childbearing age are not forced to choose between quality of life or the chance to have children most women requiring surgery for a prolapse will be referred for a hysterectomy by their gp says mr broome who performs the 4000 procedure for both nhs and private patients at hospitals in lancashire and greater manchester that means some women are faced with the dilemma of living a normal life without a prolapse or the possibility of having children far too many gps recommend hysterectomies as the solution to a prolapse when a sacrohysteropexy is a much better alternative its a shorter operation with shorter recovery time because it is less invasive and fertility is not put at risk pelvic organ prolapse or pop occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs  including the womb  becomes weak typically after childbirth file image common causes of prolapse include childbirth lower levels of oestrogen at menopause being overweight and chronic illnesses such as lung diseases which create pressure inside the abdomen from coughing half of women over 50 will have symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and more than one in ten will have had surgery for the problem by the age of 80 concerns have been raised about the use of mesh implants in gynaecological procedures with some women in scotland and the us complaining of problems including bleeding and infections but consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist clive spencejones says the risk of complications where mesh is inserted abdominally is very small medical watchdog the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency has received two reports of adverse incidents relating to a sacrohysteropexy since 2011 a sacrohysteropexy is keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic to put the womb back into its normal position tiny cuts are made in the stomach through which a telescope and instruments are passed a piece of mesh is inserted via an incision along the bikini line using tiny needles one end of the mesh is attached to the back of the cervix and the other to the coccyx and it is fixed with metal staples the mesh is also covered with a thin layer of tissue to prevent scar tissue forming encouraging the tissue to grow and make the repair stronger it can stay in place indefinitely and does not require a repeat operation the procedure takes half an hour and involves an overnight stay in hospital mr spencejones agrees that too many women are given the wrong advice on what surgery is right for them there seems to be a notion in general practice that taking everything  in other words a hysterectomy  is the answer to a prolapse when that isnt the case he says sparing the fertility is a reason for considering procedures other than a hysterectomy but not the only one one woman who says her life has been transformed by a sacrohysteropexy is 44yearold mother oftwo karen bane from lancashire she suffered feelings of bloatedness following the birth of her daughters gabrielle seven and jessica five i felt sluggish  i had back pain sitting was uncomfortable and intercourse was painful id also started to have leakage it was mortifying being a woman in my early 40s and not being able to control my bladder i put up with the symptoms for five years but when i started to have bleeding i knew enough was enough i was a mother of two young children yet all i could see were years of misery in front of me karen went to her gp with her symptoms in may 2014 and was referred to mr broome he performed the procedure at euxton hall hospital in chorley lancashire last october karen says the procedure has given her a new lease of life i can run skip and hulahoop with my daughters without giving it a second thought she explains i feel so much more feminine since my operation  my only battle scars are tiny nicks on my stomach and because i had a sacrohysteropexy rather than a hysterectomy everything is

            "and so what were doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like hurricane sandy or big wildfires or droughts that people recognize theres a very personal potential impact in climate change and the good news is we can do something about it in many ways obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us while conceding that we dont fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health when asked what the average american can do about all this the president encouraged ordinary citizens doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change he also issued a presidential proclamation declaring april 612 as national public health week to better understand communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities the average american can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint including   change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights one cfl can reduce up to 1300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime if every house in the us switched its bulbs we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half  unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use according to the us department of energy this practice can save 100 a year on your energy bill  use a laptop instead of a desktop laptops are designed to be energyefficient because battery life is a major factor in their design according to energy star a laptop can be up to 80 more energyefficient than a desktop  filter your own water beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store  adjust your curtains and thermostats if you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter you can save big bucks on your energy bill the department of energy estimates you can save up to 15 on your bill by turning off your thermostat when youre not at home obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current supreme court challenge to the affordable care act he  said he believes the statute is clear and straightforward he said i am not anticipating the supreme court would make such a bad decision at issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so the plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the affordable care act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states without statebased exchanges possibly creating a situation for example in which people in massachusetts would receive a tax credit but people living in texas would not obama did tell me that if the supreme court challenge is upheld however there is no plan b millions of people would lose their health insurance they would no longer be able to afford the health insurance thats being provided out there obama went on to say i think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against the affordable care act for ideological reasons he told me that he gets letters every day from people who say you know what the affordable care act saved my life or saved my kids life because i got insurance i thought i was healthy turns out i had a tumor but because i went and got a checkup it was removed in time and im now cancerfree  he added i think stories like that will be factored in when the supreme court takes a look at this case cnns ben tinker contributed to this report cnnpresident barack obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point after the event at washingtons howard university on tuesday obama sat down with me for a oneonone interview i asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average american to take away as well as how enforceable his action plan is here are five things i learned  the president enrolled at occidental college in los angeles in 1979 he transferred to columbia university his junior year while in la he said the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside he remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside he credits the clean air act with making americans a lot healthier in addition to being able to see the mountains in the background because they arent covered in smog obama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken peerreviewed environmental protection agency studies say that the clean air act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction the epa estimates that between 1970 and 2010 the act and its amendments prevented 365000 early deaths from particulate matter alone no challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change the president told me when i asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health he said we know as temperatures rise insectborne diseases potentially start shifting up we know in a very straightforward fashion that heatstroke and other heatrelated illnesses and deaths potentially increase\n",

            "well he was just about to return from a cruciate ligament injury that had sidelined him for three months the argentinian manager has imposed his incredible work ethic on his players since joining atletico  simeone has turned atletico around since joining in december 2011 and recently extended his deal  his atletico madrid teammates were stagnating under coach gregorio manzano and had just been knocked out of the cup by a third division side albacete costa had previously been out on loan at albacete and had the good grace to go into their dressingroom after the game and congratulate his former teammates on their giantkilling scalp back in his own dressing room the mood was bleak the team were closer to the relegation zone than the european places and manzano was soon sacked and replaced by simeone sceptics said his inexperience as a coach in europe would prevent him succeeding romantics said the former captain and double winner at atletico would bring back the glory days the romantics were right without costa who was at first loaned out to rayo vallecano simeones atletico won the europa league and the european super cup costa returned to help them win the copa del rey and the league as well as making last seasons champions league final that final in lisbon seemed to put real back on top in the spanish capital but simeones noisy neighbours have refused to pipedown in the six subsequent matches between the two sides they have not let real win a single game in the twolegged spanish super cup at the start of the season atletico drew 11 in the bernabeu and beat real 10 in the calderon they then went to the bernabeu in the league and won 21 saul scores a brilliant bicycle kick during the 40 win over real at the vicente calderon earlier this season  cristiano ronaldo and gareth bale were unable to do anything to prevent atleticos dominance in february  and when the two teams were drawn against each other in the copa del rey atletico won the first leg 20 and then drew the second worse was to come for real madrid in the league in february when they lost the away fixture 40 this season atletico madrid are not going to win the league but no one is ruling out another tilt at the prize they were seconds from winning last season  leading from diego godins goal until the last minute when sergio ramos scored to take the match to extra time atletico players had told anyone who would listen throughout last season that while they didnt give themselves much of a chance in la liga up against the stronger squads of real madrid and barcelona they did fancy themselves in the champions league  we can beat anyone over two legs was the message and that still stands they showed tremendous resilience to come through against bayer leverkusen in the last round with fernando torres scoring the last penalty of the shootout ronaldo scored the fourth goal in real madrids win over their rivals in last years champions league final  simeones players watch on after losing out in lisbon but are determined to bounce back this year  he put through his own net at the weekend in the league typifying that faltering league form and will probably make way for mario mandzukic tuesday the batteringram bought from bayern in the summer to replace costa has not always met simeones demands for constant pressing of the oppositions defence this season after a fallout with simone who in one recent match was visibly furious with his striker a fragile truce has been called although the likes of psgs edinson cavani and villarreals luciano vietto are being looked at as replacements for next season mandzukic told his manager recently that he had regularly played through injury and wanted resting he was obliged and now looks set to be brought back in to face pepe and sergio ramos former bayern munich striker mario mandzukic behind is set to start alongside antoine griezmann  mandzukic has patched up his relationship with simeone and will play ahead of fernando torres on tuesday  tuesday night may well be as much about keeping a clean sheet as scoring ronaldo returns the scene of madrids biggest crime this season  that 40 defeat in the league on the day he celebrated his 30th birthday sometimes in training simeone likes to play a very special game of attack against defence he lines up a first team back seven against 14 youth teamers hes proud of the firstteam defences ability to keep the ball out of their goal despite being outnumbered two to one whether 14 youth team players amounts to more or less than gareth bale ronaldo and karim benzema is open to debate one of diego simeones many managerial mantras  and there are already enough to fill a volume that would rival louis van gaals biographie  vision  is i always think that tomorrow i could be sacked it perfectly illustrates his work ethic and his obsession with guarding against complacency but even he must know that right now noone is further from the chop than the 44yearold coach who took atletico madrid to the title last season and leads them into the champions league quarterfinal against real madrid on tuesday night there was a communal sigh letout across several boardrooms of top european football clubs two weeks ago when he put pen to paper on a new deal that ties him to the club until 2019 diego simeone shows off his playing skills as he prepare atletico madrid for their champions league clash  simeone talks to his squad ahead of real madrids visit on tuesday night in the quarter final first leg  sporting directors from manchester to milan were watching his situation carefully and the new four year contract with the option of a fifth season appears to have ended his chances of arriving in italy or england this summer back home in madrid the atletico supporters were delirious at the news never mind that last years title will not be repeated this season the fans have long enough memories to remember how bad things were back in december 2011 before his appointment current chelsea striker diego costa would also remember that period\n",

            "and you have got to say that the circumstances they worked under were probably the poorest of any manager at any time in rangers history people can make their own judgments of how a manager does a job all i would say is that everyone has to have support i got the support of david murray when i was manager at rangers and he was a big help to me they never had that help they didnt get any help stuart mccall has come in at a time when everybody is looking a bit brighter for a change at rangers it is a good time for him to come in stuart mccall is now in charge of the scottish championship side and has impressed since taking over  it certainly wasnt a good time when alistair took over craig whyte came in and that coincided with alistair i felt not getting a fair opportunity it is very difficult to judge him as a manager under the circumstances that he worked in i certainly wouldnt have liked to have worked under them anyway the mccoist legacy has drawn unfavourable comments from supporters signings such as dean shiels david templeton and ian black arrived on wages which were barely justified by their performances in a light blue shirt some voiced doubts over mccoists tactical acumen while others asked why younger players werent given more of a chance to blossom in the lower leagues yet smith argues that both mccoist and mcdowall deserve to be remembered for what they did during his own highly successful second spell at rangers prior to the financial tsunami which plunged the club over a fiscal cliff i was the manager alistair was the assistant manager and kenny was the coach and for four and a half years when the club was well run we did well said the former scotland boss smith believes ally mccoist deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club  i am not a miracle person i couldnt run rangers football club on my own the people that i worked with there did a terrific job i know their strengths everyone has got strengths and weaknesses walter smith says ally mccoist deserves a chance to prove himself as a successful manager at a stable club the ibrox legend worked closely with mccoist and coach kenny mcdowall before the duo assumed the reins at rangers during four years of unprecedented turmoil off and on the pitch charged with leading the club back to the premiership from the bottom tier mccoist finally resigned and was placed on gardening leave in december and is still earning 14000 a week while his 12month notice period runs down walter smith says ally mccoist deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club  mcdowall who reluctantly took over as caretaker boss before leaving in march to be replaced by stuart mccall is also awaiting a final severance deal which would free him up to work elsewhere yet despite leaving the club under a cloud smith insists that both men have something left to offer in football and he blames boardroom turmoil under craig whyte charles green and the mike ashleyeasdale brothers axis for contributing towards an unmanageable situation i think they want an opportunity said the former rangers manager and chairman of his two former colleagues after working with them for a number of years and them getting the opportunity to go in and take over which i got when graeme souness left the boys were always hoping they would get the opportunity there was no guarantee of that but i had never been in that circumstance before so how could i give him any advice in terms of how rangers were being run it is an unfair judgement for people to make on him because of the circumstances mccoist is rangers record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future  alistair and kenny would take a lot of the training\n",

            "there is a passage in diego torress book the special one  the secret world of jose mourinho which goes a long way to understanding the practices of chelseas manager in the english version of torress biography the exchanges between mourinho and cristiano ronaldo in the dressing room at real madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 champions league semifinal against barcelona when ronaldo had made it clear he expected los blancos to be more adventurous in the bernabeu jose mourinho makes a point to oscar and his brazilian teammate willian during a game at stamford bridge  mourinho has been called out by players for being too defensive before by cristiano ronaldo at real madrid  oscar holds his head in his hands after missing a good chance at stoke where he was replaced at half time  oscar hasnt completed a full 90 minutes for chelsea since midjanuary here is is full recent record  jan 31 manchester city substituted 89 feb 7 aston villa substituted 73 feb 11 everton unused feb 17 paris saint germain substitute 83 feb 21 burnley substituted 72 mar 1 tottenham substitute 88 mar 4 west ham substituted 74 mar 11 paris saint germain substituted 45 mar 15 southampton substituted 82 mar 22 hull substitute 61 apr 4 stoke substituted 45 according to torres the real madrid coach told his star player im going to say it to your face you complain that we play defensively but do you know why we play this way for you because as you dont want to defend or cover the wings i have to have the team sitting deep when you come on you do your own thing that meeting held in the presence of the great zinedine zidane apparently lasted 40 minutes real madrid drew the second leg 11 and barcelona progressed to the final where they beat manchester united 31 at wembley team meetings are a theme of mourinhos management giving his players the floor during the fallow periods that inevitably occur during the course of a long season it is a pragmatic approach one to be admired unless you happen to be one of the players who challenges mourinhos coaching philosophy you cannot blame oscar the current fallguy for encouraging chelsea to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of january when you can call upon oscar eden hazard and willian why wouldnt you oscar has been put back in his box in recent weeks failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for chelsea since the 10 victory over liverpool in the capital one cup semifinal second leg on january 27 the brazilian midfielder has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of chelseas last 11 games  mourinho demands that the likes of oscar work hard on their defensive roles to free eden hazards flair  the brazilian forward has not completed a barclays premier league match since the 50 victory at swansea city where he scored twice for the league leaders 10 days earlier oscar put chelsea ahead in the opening minute at the liberty stadium and his second when he beat swansea keeper lukas fabianski in the 36th minute from the edge of the area is the last time he has scored since the 10 victory over liverpool in the capital one cup at stamford bridge oscar has been substituted or been named substitute in 10 of chelseas last 11 fixtures here is the record in full manchester city substituted 89 aston villa substituted 73 paris saintgermain substitute 83 burnley substituted 72 tottenham substitute 88 west ham substituted 74 paris saintgermain substituted 45 southampton substituted 82 hull substitute 61 stoke substituted 45 against everton on february 11 he was not in the squad naturally oscar has some concerns worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers oscar was disappointing during last weekends win and mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards  the chelsea star tries a fancy flick but little of what he tried came off during the win against stoke  it is believed to have been innocuous an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the chelsea dressing room since his move from internacional in 2012 he is certainly not regarded as a troublemaker it was oscar after all who is so highlyregarded by the coaching staff at chelsea that he was considered a potential future rival to the annual duel between lionel messi and ronaldo for the ballon dor when oscar returned from the world cup where he scored the 90th minute goal for his country in their 71 rout by germany in the semifinal his firstclass attitude to the new season was noted by coaching staff despite the disappointment over the summer with the national team he was eager to please mourinho as he entered his third season with chelsea in november his sparkling form was rewarded with a new fiveyear contract a move designed to keep him in that role off the main striker diego costa until 2019 all was well oscar was dejected after brazils world cup semi final defeat but he returned to chelsea with a good attitude  the chelsea midfielder suggested the side should be more positive with the likes of eden hazard and willian  when oscar arrived at the club he was thought of as a future ballon dor winner but his place is now in doubt  there is a touch of brian clough about mourinhos attitude towards him a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players we talk about it for 20 minutes no i dont think he had a bad performance i just think his performance was not good enough which is a huge difference claimed chelseas manager after their 21 victory over stoke city on saturday naturally there is a little uncertainty about oscars performances at the moment reluctant to try anything out of the ordinary because of the potential consequences oscar knows like everyone else knows that if you take on mourinho he will take you off and then we decide i was right all along clough once remarked oscar is certainly learning all about that as he deals with mourinhos mood swings\n",

            "an alabama inmate who spent nearly 30 years on death row will go free on friday after prosecutors told a court there is not enough evidence to link him to the 1985 murders he was convicted of committing jefferson county circuit judge laura petro on thursday dismissed the case against anthony ray hinton the district attorneys office told the judge wednesday that their forensic experts couldnt determine if six crime scene bullets  which were the crux of the evidence against hinton at an expected retrial  came from a gun investigators took from his home hinton was convicted of two 1985 murders that occurred during robberies of fastfood restaurants near birmingham prosecutors linked hinton to the killings through a 38caliber revolver found at his house couldnt match the bullets anthony ray hinton pictured this week spent nearly 30 years on alabamas death row but will be freed friday morning after prosecutors told a judge they wont retry him for two slayings  all smiles anthony ray hinton hugs his family members  after learning he will walk free after spending 30 years behind bars  the us supreme court last year sent hintons case back for a potential new trial which prompted a reexamination of the evidence weve been hoping for this weve believed that this should have happened said bryan stevenson hintons attorney and director of the alabamabased equal justice initiative the jefferson county district attorneys office could not immediately be reached for comment stevenson has been arguing for 16 years that hinton was innocent and that he was at his job at a warehouse when the crimes were committed hinton wept wednesday night after learning the news that he would finally go free stevenson said a spokesman for the alabama department of corrections said hinton is expected to be released from the jefferson county jail on friday morning every day every month every year that the state took from him they took something that they dont have the power to give back while this moment is quite joyous and is quite wonderful this case is quite tragic stevenson said at his initial trial state experts testified that the four bullets fired during the robberies and another two from a similar robberyshooting at a quincys restaurant in bessemer had all been fired from a revolver found at hintons home going free former death row inmate anthony ray hinton pictured in an undated older mugshot and an undated more recent mugshot will go free on friday after being imprisoned for 30 years  the supreme court last year ruled that hinton had constitutionally deficient representation at his initial trial hintons defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only 1000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution evidence according the court opinion hintons lawyer hired the only person willing to take the job at that price even though he had concerns about the experts credentials he was a poor person who was convicted because he didnt have the money to prove his innocence at trial he was unable to get the legal help he needed for years he was convicted based on bad science stevenson said chief deputy jefferson county district attorney john bowers met with the families of the victims of the shooting and they were angered by the news understandably they were upset and frustrated by the news but ultimately they understood why we couldnt proceed with the prosecution of these cases bowers said theres no closure one way or the other he added the experts did not say it did come from the pistol or that it didnt come from the pistol its never happened in all my years of prosecution bowers said told alcom of releasing a death row inmate new beginning anthony ray hinton pictured this week had improper representation 30 years ago because he was poor said his attorney  the experts were unable to tie hintons gun to the bullets used at the crime scene three highlyqualified and experienced adfs forensic scientists who are experts in the field of firearms and tool mark identification each performed independent forensic examinations of the submitted bullets and firearm the motion to dismiss charges said utilizing comparison microscopy each expert intercompared all six bullets recovered during the investigations of the three crimes to each other and to bullets test fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from hintons home bowers said that the experts who examined the gun did not find enough evidence to prove hintons involvement due to insufficient corresponding individual microscopic characteristics all three experts found that they could not conclusively determine that any of the six bullets were or were not fired through the same firearm or that they were fired through the firearm recovered from hintons home  the motion continues the only potential evidence that has ever been available to the state to prove that the defendant committed the murders of john davidson and thomas wayne vason depends upon an absolute conclusive determination that the bullets recovered from their bodies were in fact fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from the hintons home the motionsays based on the microscopic comparisons and conclusions of all three of the adfs firearms and tool mark identification experts the state does not have sufficient evidence to warrant further prosecution of these cases\n",

            "cnnthe verdict of the opinion polls on the uk election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough between david cameron of the conservatives ed miliband of labour nick clegg of the liberal democrats nigel farage of the united kingdom independence party natalie bennett of the green party nicola sturgeon of the scottish national party and leanne wood of plaid cymru the welsh nationalists there really was no clear winner comres for itv which staged the debate had cameron miliband and farage tied first with 21 and sturgeon close behind on 20 icm for the guardian scored it miliband 25 cameron 24 farage 19 and sturgeon 17 yougov for the times put sturgeon first with 28 points to 20 for farage 18 for cameron and only 15 for miliband back in the 1950s uk politics was simpler labour and conservatives combined took 97 of the votes but nowadays they struggle to collect twothirds of the national vote between them in our antipolitics age nationalists and others have advanced and the leaders tv debate was no gladiatorial contest with a straightforward outcome rather it was a cacophonous shouting match that probably gave all parties supporters some satisfaction but which offered little new insight to the undecided voter from a highly confused affair we can perhaps take six lessons  as the incumbent prime minister cameron is probably wise to have refused all invitations to go head to head with miliband alone in verbal fisticuffs he has risked being labelled a coward for doing so but it was a tactical decision miliband has been given a hard time by the british media who have gloated over his difficulties in eating a bacon sandwich and presented him as an awkward geek but labours leader is a perfectly capable debater he could only gain from their confrontation as it is election time media exposure has already seen milibands ratings as a leader improve the electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two main leaders are emerging in an earlier clash involving separate sessions before a studio audience and in a grilling by uk tvs grand inquisitor jeremy paxman cameron proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration on the number of people employed on zerohours contracts and on being too kind to the rich in his taxation policies miliband has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget deficit and how he will curb immigration he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother david to get the leaders job the impression so far is that britains voters dont much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but dont quite trust labour to continue the improvement miliband told by his handlers to look tough is using the i word too much cameron is curiously short on passion an oddity of the seven up debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved sturgeon of the scottish national party and wood of plaid cymru but sturgeons high score in the postdebate polls was significant she was sharp and sassy the number of seats gained by the nationalists currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 westminster parliament seats in scotland will be crucial last time labour won 41 of those seats the more the snp take the weaker labours chance of a majority at westminster will be miliband says he wont form a coalition with the snp but it could be difficult for labour to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border if there was a winner in the debate it was nicola sturgeon back in the 2010 uk election debates the clear victor was clegg of the liberal democrats then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting i agree with nick by entering a coalition government with cameron in which the lib dems insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery clegg surrendered the lib dems previous ability to pick up protest votes clegg and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government notably on student tuition fees his debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10 perception is everything in social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the greens and even for plaid cymrus wood but clegg got hardly a mention the united kingdom independence party remains the joker in the pack the party once dismissed by cameron as a collection of fruitcakes loonies and closet racists is a serious threat to the conservatives  and labour  despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately but ukip more than any of the others is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them grinning farages blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration his party wont win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests sometimes taking votes off the conservatives sometimes off labour farage has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60 of hiv cases he earned condemnation from other leaders on social media dominated by the young that earned him the maximum boo count to win a tv election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself to wrongfoot your opponent and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum you need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign the highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money the emphasis has been on sound defense nobody has yet scored an exciting goal as the campaign moves on chances will have to be taken read fish bacon and beer the real issues in britains election\n",

            "weve kept our hands off him simply because of the under 21s but we know hes a big prospect and the moment he comes back from the czech republic hell be very much in our thoughts mason believes more youngsters would come through if managers were willing to take a chance on the likes of him the germans and spanish are not better than us technically he said but they get given the opportunity younger in their league so they get the chance to come and play in the premier league i understand there is a lot of pressure on managers to get instant results but english players know the league and there is plenty of talent out there if english players can start coming through it will benefit our national team it should also benefit the clubs especially the elite with the majority of the worlds best players emerging from south america spain and germany those players are likely to aspire to play for real madrid barcelona and bayern munich premier league clubs cannot expect to match those european giants unless the english game produces a foundation of top talent but the mail on sunday research demonstrates just which clubs and more importantly which managers are prepared to take a risk on young english talent the acid test is whether a manager will start a player in a premier league game using that criterion and then listing which managers have started with english players under the age of 23 in the past three seasons pochettino emerges as the champion of the english among current premier league bosses norwegian ole gunnar solskjaer did his bit during his admittedly unsuccessful time at cardiff but two scottish managers alan irvine and malky mackay also feature high in our league table as does northern irishman brendan rodgers and perhaps surprisingly portuguese andre villasboas ole gunnar solskjaer did his bit for homegrown development during his unsuccessful time at cardiff  former west brom boss alan irvine also did before his dismissal at the hawthorns  when the figures are broken down club by club southampton liverpool and arsenal are top of the league with chelsea bottom in fact chelsea have not started an under 23 player qualified to play for england since ryan bertrand and sam hutchinson played on the last day of the 201112 season against blackburn a few months before they turned 23 because of the lack of english youngsters available to them chelsea managers jose mourinho rafael benitez and roberto di matteo are bottom of the managerial table perhaps the emergence of patrick bamford on loan at middlesbrough or highly rated dominic solanke will change that next term patrick bamford is currently on loan from chelsea at championship side middlesbrough  dominic solanke is another player impressing at england youth level in chelseas setup  the irony is that chelsea have the best youth setup in the country having won the fa youth cup three times in the past five years  and they are in the final again this year manuel pellegrini is also near the bottom of the managerial table jack rodwell now at sunderland is the only englishman under 23 pellegrini has ever fielded during his time at manchester city but the issue is clearly more complex than simply pointing the finger at foreignowned bigspending clubs stoke city owned by one of englands most passionate supporters in peter coates are near the bottom of the table as is hull city manager steve bruce so quite where mason and his like would be without argentinian support is open to question pochettino it appears is already doing more to change the culture of english football than any commission or directive but when tim sherwood was replaced by pochettino 23yearold mason had reasons to be cheerful at the start of the season i was looking forward to it because of what the gaffer did at southampton and his record of bringing young players through he said leftright ryan mason kyle walker townsend and harry kane celebrate in the game against italy  mason made his debut for england against italy in midweek after breaking into the spurs team this season  which managers have the most faith in young english talent the mail on sunday looked at premier league clubs in the past three years since the start of the 201213 season to see where homegrown talent was getting the most opportunities to play after counting the amount of league starts handed out by each manager to english players aged under 23 the percentage of each managers total starting selections shows that mauricio pochettino below of active bosses backs young talent most this table shows the top 10 and bottom six managers out of 42 showing their total player selections and games and the percentage of all starters who fit our young and english criteria and three chelsea managers make up the bottom three pochettinos record of sticking by english players such as rickie lambert adam lallana and jay rodriguez and backing youngsters such as luke shaw calum chambers and james wardprowse in the southampton first team struck a chord with mason and his peers the argentine is a godsend for fa chairman greg dyke whose commission is attempting to find ways to nudge more managers into playing their young english players rather than rely on often mediocre imported talent he is honest and picks the team on how youre training said mason of his manager and if you are in the team and doing well then youre staying there its brilliant for young players as he gives you that opportunity mason kane and walker were quick to congratulate their teammate townsend on scoring englands spectacular equaliser in the 11 draw with italy only walker is not from the spurs academy having joined from sheffield united at 19 masons girlfriend rachel has had a copy of the turin celebration photo framed for his living room another man who enjoyed pochettinos support may soon be joining those four in the england squad wardprowse 20 who scored the winner for england under 21s against germany on monday and who should be a key player at the european championship this summer is likely to be promoted to the senior squad when that tournament in the czech republic is over james wardprowse right of southampton could be another to soon join them in the england squad  england boss roy hodgson admitted 20yearold wardprowse is another player currently in their thoughts  ryan masons parents missed his england debut as high winds caused their flight to italy to be cancelled they made a failed lastminute dash to get to the match via germany but didnt make it to turin in time spurs mason who plays at burnley today said they were devastated we like him said england manager roy hodgson the saviour of english football turns out to be a longhaired argentinian who tripped michael owen to give away the penalty that david beckham converted in the 2002 world cup finals mauricio pochettino 43 who has long since lost the flowing locks in favour of something a little more in keeping with his managerial status has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in england just over two years ago it is not just his coaching which is admired he is also becoming the manager for whom young englishmen wish to play as exclusive research by the mail on sunday proves mauricio pochettino could be the saviour of english football thanks to his faith in homegrown talent  the argentine has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in england just over two years ago  andros townsend second left celebrates his goal for england alongside his young tottenham teammates  in the week in which four of his young tottenham players  harry kane andros townsend ryan mason and kyle walker  all played for england mason has paid tribute to the impact the argentine has had on the english game a year ago an england debut was the last thing on masons mind after spending the previous season on loan at swindon and unused by tottenham he feared he would have to leave the club i was in the last two years of my contract and getting to that age when if it didnt happen this season i probably would look to leave said mason\n",

            "she said that snp mps at westminster could vigorously and loudly support a future labour government in some areas the snp leader added john majors comments are silly over the top and frankly they dont show him in a particularly good light i want the snp to go to westminster to make scotlands voice heard and also to be a voice for better politics for the kind of politics that stands in opposition to tory policies of austerity and undermining public services and pushing more people into poverty i can understand why that message of standing up for ordinary people not just in scotland but across the uk might offend john major as an extory prime minister but i think its a message that will continue to win support right across scotland the former prime minister sought to contrast the social division he said was sown up labours politics with the economic competence and strongly beating heart he said typifies the tories  nicola sturgeon is threatening to break up the uk without even bothering to stand for election to westminster sir john major said today in a personal attack on the snp leader sir john cast doubt on the legitimacy of a party which only stands in one part of the country setting the direction of the national government they are part of the united kingdom and so of course they have got the right to have a degree of legitimacy he said but he accused ms sturgeon of plotting the breakup of the union from edinburgh what im saying is i dont think the snp party whose leader is not even bothering to run for the westminster election are behaving in a way that is in the interest of the united kingdom by seeking policies that will break scotland away from the united kingdom and they emphatically will not deny that separatism is their aim after last years vote saw 55 per cent of scots reject the idea of separation nationalists insisted the issue was settled for a generation but ms sturgeon has since left the door open to a second referendum before 2020 sir john said the snp would manufacture grievance to make a yes vote more likely any future referendum they will ask for the impossible and create merry hell if it is denied the nightmare of a broken united kingdom has not gone away the separation debate is not over the snp is determined to prise apart the united kingdom ms sturgeon yesterday unveiled an antiausterity manifesto setting out her price for propping up a weak labour government including higher spending fuelled by more borrowing polls continue to show up to half of scots are planning to back the snp robbing labour of dozens of seats and depriving mr miliband of hopes of a majority mr miliband and ms sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition with snp mps sitting in cabinet but they have left open the possibility of the snp supporting a labour government on a votebyvote basis raising the prospect of mr miliband being forced to bow to their demands to get any legislation through sir john warned that this will leave the country open to a daily dose of blackmail as the snp makes fresh demands in return for supporting labour in commons votes if labour were to accept an offer of support from the snp it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a votebyvote basis sir john said labour would be in hock to a party that  slowly but surely  will push them ever further to the left and who would pay the price for this we all would we would all pay for the snps ransom in our daily lives  through higher taxes fewer jobs and more and more debt this is a recipe for mayhem at the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government we risk a weak and unstable one  pushed to the left by its allies and open to a daily dose of political blackmail and labours alistair darling who led the no campaign against scottish independence said the tories were flirting with english nationalism in a desperate way which could lead to another period of divisive wrangling over scotlands position labour leader ed miliband accused the conservatives and david cameron of talking up the snp in the hope that the nationalists will win seats from labour north of the border and allow him to crawl back into 10 downing street a poll showed just 22 per cent of voters across the uk back the idea of ms sturgeon playing a role in the uk government with 54 per cent opposed  the snp has already suggested that it will be entitled to vote against any bit of legislation and any bit of spending it does not agree with it means that for labour to pass new laws or agree to spending in england wales or northern ireland they would have to strike a deal with the snp much of the snp manifesto appeared designed to demonstrate common ground with labour promising to scrap the bedroom tax reverse nhs reforms increase the minimum wage and tackle energy bills but in key areas it went much further threatening to drag labour further to the left to make the party bolder and better it included scrapping the trident nuclear deterrent ending austerity and embarking on a 140billion spending spree in a series of coordinated conservative attacks david cameron warned a laboursnp deal would be a match made in hell for the british economy london mayor boris johnson said allowing scottish nationalists to preside of the uk government would be like getting herod to run a baby farm but some tories fear the attacks could backfire lord forsyth  who served as scottish secretary in sir johns government  warned that building up the snp to undermine support for labour in england could ultimately damage the union weve had the dilemma for conservatives which is they want to be the largest party at westminster but instead it fanned the flame which lead to the referendum which left the union battered but intact now it is at risk again he said labours only route back to power is in hock to smaller left wing parties he said leading to more borrowing more spending an end to welfare reform and far more people dragged into higher tax brackets welsh nationalists plaid cymru would demand more money for wales while the worthy green partys economic plan is a recipe for economic selfharm he warned of mayhem if the snp holds the balance of power with a weak labour government open to a daily dose of blackmail to secure the support of the nationalists in commons votes the snp would use its role in westminster to bolster support ahead of next years scottish parliament elections when it will put independence back on the agenda sir john said the tories hope to capitalise on a damning poll which shows more than half of british voters want ms sturgeon and her party to play no part in the next government the snp is a real and present danger to our future sir john said they will pit scotland against england that could be disastrous to the people of scotland  and fatal to the uk as a whole but ms sturgeon branded his comments an affront to democracy addressing the scottish trades union

jordan loved dancing  and he was killed because of it she told of how her son longed to go on britains got talent and how he had made a recording of an ed sheeran song  jordan brennan was attacked in september last year as he left his local shop his favourite question was have you got 1 mum in tribute his mother kim says they all threw a pound coin into his grave for him  jordan was attacked in september 2014 after breaking into the dance made famous by south korean artist psy but it enraged the other boy 16 who thought his south east asian ethnicity was being mocked after claiming jordan bumped into him as he spun round the 16year old attacker tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise  but the pair became involved in a tussle as they struggled jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters before his head hit the concrete floor below college student jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up he was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when kim tried to raise him for breakfast tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain at manchester crown court in march the killer now 17 was jailed for eight months speaking about the incident for the first time kim said his sixyearold sister had taught him a new dance on the day he died and he was showing off in his local shop in high spirits which was typical of him speaking about the incident for the first time kim said of jordan his sixyearold sister had taught him a new dance on the day he died and he was

whilst forensics took over it was horrendous millie kept asking for her big brother our whole family was devastated a now 17yearold youth was charged with murder but prosecutors accepted a guilty plea to manslaughter concluding he could not be proven he intended to kill the court heard the flashpoint for the fatal incident was jordan dancing and making reference to gangnam style the attacker claimed he took the remarks as racist and mocking because of his ethnicity but prosecutor rob hall said jordan may simply have been in high spirits and exuberant and that he was of good character and there was nothing at all to suggest his actions were racist the youth was jailed for just eight months leaving kim and her family devastated kim said for the killer to say he took jordans dance as racist or offensive is disgusting jordan was just dancing as he always did regardless of who was watching jordan was killed because he had a sense of fun thats all there is to it its a disgrace that his killer is allowed to say such things when my son isnt here to talk for himself there is no justice at all the sentence is an insult to jordans memory he was lots of fun he loved music and dancing and when gangnam style was released he loved it he would dance and sing all the time he was a real showoff he always sang in front of the mirror and he loved admiring himself his favourite question

media for refusing to give up on going out and enjoying herself now her boyfriend is out of rehab  some other commenters on crowleys instagram page are more forgiving its your life keep doin you and forget the haters writers one supporter the cleveland browns quarterback stayed away from the booze on tuesday night and was seen sipping nothing stronger than water throughout the game manziels partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last july with some worried his drinking was a priority  according to espn manziel was doing great in rehab and had the full support of his team now comes the real test as offseason workouts with the team will begin next monday april 20 manziel will be forced to compete with josh mccown for the starting quarterback position who just signed a 14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons manziel was joined by his girlfriend colleen crowley and sipped water throughout tuesday night  this after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the cleveland browns season last december but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem especially after one incident last year when after partying until well past midnight manziel who is suffering from an injured hamstring skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept and in turn was fined by the browns manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior saying its about being accountable instead of looking like a jackass and while his season may have been over at that time many believed manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy the athlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released on saturday it was all the more shocking then when he was spotted partying at fdr lounge at the delano in miami over the new year holiday alongside the likes of lebron james and ryan phillippe and then he was seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend crowley and some buddies poolside at the delano at this point some in the sports world chief among them columnist skip bayless began to suggest that the heisman trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking appearing on espns first take bayless a noted supporter of manziel did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking my concern i repeatedly said was if johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails then im going to be out said bayless in talking to people in and around the cleveland browns i believe johnny manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol and i believe  that it is time for johnny to get some help manziel while the 2013 heisman trophy as the quarterback of the texas am university aggies  he continues to lie to his executives to his coaches to his teammates to the media and most of all he continues to lie to himself he then said he would label manziel an alcoholic manziel was known for his partying while at texas am but said he was a changed man during the 2014 nfl draft noting that he had grown up before being selected 22nd overall by cleveland just days into his training with the browns however the local press began calling him out on his partying which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field a source told clevelandcom at the time team officials had bought into manziels predraft promises to tone down the partying and leave his fratboy lifestyle back in college station texas and theyve been stunned by his nonstop antics the partyloving girlfriend of footballer johnny manziel has come under fire on social media for refusing to give

            "a dozen or more metal implements are arranged in neat rows on the table next to the bed they look like something frankenstein might have had applied to his monsters neck i begin to feel nervous what on earth have i got myself into the pristine white room adds to the feeling that im about to undergo major surgery but im not im here to try the wackiest face treatment to hit the beauty scene the tuning fork facial offered at the upmarket hale clinic in london and other clinics nationwide the scary sounding tuning forks are pieces of metal that make different pitched sounds when struck and made to vibrate tuned in marianne is given the tuning fork treatment  when they are placed on specific parts of the face  the neck the jowls forehead and around the eyes  vibrations are said to tighten sagging skin eradicate dark circles lessen the appearance of wrinkles and stimulate collagen the results mean that your face looks younger brighter and more toned some say its the nonjab equivalent of botox the treatment comes from the us  where else advocates claim the sound waves of the forks vibrate and travel deeply into the body along energy pathways affecting human physiology and reaching places not easily accessed so far so new age gibberish there seems to be no scientific proof that tuning forks can make you look younger prettier or more rested it sounds nutty  the kind of thing practised by people who like panpipes and hemp seeds the uk beauty industry employs more a million people and is worth 17 bn  i prefer my facials to involve peels not strange pieces of metal but while i may be sceptical i am also at 37 willing to try anything over the past few years frown lines have begun to appear on my forehead and my face appears increasingly pale puffy and bloated i explain all this to therapist samara reid whos sympathetic whats wonderful about these facials is they improve the appearance of the skin but also treat the cause of the problem she says if youre pale you probably have poor circulation the forks can boost blood flow which will give you a healthier colour samara has been a facial acupuncturist for 20 years but she has started using the forks on their own and in conjunction with needles i can see my jawline for the first time in a while and my skin looks plumper and pink rather than white the therapies work on the same principle of chinese acupuncture which follows the idea that our bodys energy  or qi  flows through 12 main channels called meridians if this flow is interrupted it can cause ill health and affect our appearance causing premature ageing dry skin and eye bags inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy improving fine lines and circulation leading to a clearer rejuvenated complexion samara uses them together for a more powerful effect but for the needlephobic the forks can be used on their own certain forks are designed for different parts of the face and the body  there are dozens of them with names such as sun earth and new moon the physical vibrations have an effect on the body while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing samara pings one of the forks and puts it up to my ear the sound is magical like a xylophone from outer space she asks me to get on the bed and remove my socks she explains she will tap my feet with the forks and apply needles to bring the energy down for grounding whatever that means before starting on the face and getting the energy flowing all around my body samara uses a gold ohm unison tuning fork she strikes it against a hard disc strapped on her leg which creates a vibration before putting the base of the fork on various points on my feet i can feel a gentle deep vibration travel through my feet and halfway up my legs its a strange tingly sensation and builds as she places the fork on more points on my feet within two minutes i feel as if im floating she then puts needles in between my toes to cleanse the system they dont hurt at all then she moves to my face she feels around my jawline and says she can feel i have raised glands she asks if i get a lot of sore throats and i say yes the vibration from the forks can help the lymph glands to drain which will help bring down the swelling she says adding that all shes doing is clearing blockages which will help everything work better inserting needles or vibrating tuning fork on these trigger points supposedly restores the flow of energy improving fine lines and circulation leading to a clearer rejuvenated complexion  marinna finds the physical vibrations have an effect on the body while the sound from the forks is simultaneously soothing  she also explains that she uses tuning forks to help tighten loose muscle around the jawline as she puts the base of the earth fork around my jawline the vibrations go deep into my head it feels odd but also rather lovely she then puts the forks up to my ears and i hear a clear deep belllike sound that feels as if its cleaning my mind all my normal chattering thoughts are gone for a moment samara who is wafting around the room ethereally as new aged therapists are wont to do explains in her soft slow voice that different forks have different sounds varying from deep and resonant to highpitched she says the new moon fork is good for wrinkles and crows feet because it relaxes the skin but when she starts talking about how the sounds will bring me into alignment with the cycles and rhythms of the cosmos it feels a step too far she found the effect was less pronounced the following day  although she still looked better  i begin to feel it is all ridiculous but then she moves up my face samara tells me i have deep lines between my nose and mouth and my cheeks are puffy she asks if i get a lot of sinus problems again i say yes shes more thorough than some gps ive seen samara presses the forks along the side of my nose where the vibrations should help drain the sinuses and then my eyes where apparently they will help reduce dark circles finally samara comes to my forehead she tells me i have a line forming between my eyebrows known as the suspended sword which can be caused by fear and concentration do you frown when you are concentrating she asks i do and do you find yourself feeling frightened quite often she asks yes this woman is a mindreader and then were done it feels as if ive been lying there for a minute but samara tells me its nearly an hour i feel spaced out im so relaxed its hard to speak apparently this is normal the result of feelgood endorphins created when pressure points are stimulated im pleasantly surprised  in the mirror my face looks less like the pilsbury doughboy i can see my jawline for the first time in a while and my skin looks plumper and pink rather than white the next morning i take a long hard look at my face the effect isnt as pronounced as the day before but my skin looks smoother and i have more colour samara recommends 12 sessions but most people see a difference after just three or four at 90 for an hour its not cheap but its reminded me of a basic beauty truth a glowing complexion isnt something to be obtained in an expensive cream  it comes from being healthy inside and out samara packs me off with some good advice drink fresh ginger tea to boost my immune system and try to avoid dairy which doesnt help if youre prone to congestion coughs and colds maybe i am the hemp seed type after all i have booked a second appointment samara reid the hale clinic london 020 7631 0156 experts recommend 12 sessions at 90 for an hour its not cheap\n",
